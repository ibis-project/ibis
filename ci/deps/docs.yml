# The docs build requires the requirements for ALL backends to be installed
# into one environment.
# 
# Ideally we would just install all of the individual backend requirements
# files one by one, but this is not possible because they are not compatibile
# with each other (will have Conda solve conflicts).
# 
# Here we combine the requirements for each backend together in one file. The
# requirements and versions here should be exactly the same as the requirements
# in the individual backend .yml files, except for requirements that MUST be
# changed to resolve conflicts.
# 
# Differences are marked with (!).
