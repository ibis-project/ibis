# Who supports Ibis?

Ibis is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from anyone! We have
a growing community of users and contributors, and we'd love to have you join
us. If you're interested in contributing, please see our [contributing
guide](/contribute).

## Voltron Data

[Voltron Data](https://voltrondata.com) is the primary sponsor of Ibis, with
most of the core development team employed there. As of writing, this includes
five full-time developers, one technical product manager, and other staff who
contribute to Ibis.

## Other companies

Ibis is used by many other companies, with various tools built on top of it.
These include:

- [Google BigQuery DataFrames](https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery-dataframes), a clone of the pandas API built on Ibis
- [Starburst Galaxy Python DataFrames](https://www.starburst.io/blog/introducing-python-dataframes/), with support for Ibis
- [Claypot AI's contribution of the Flink backend](https://github.com/claypotai/ibis-flink-example), working in collaboration with Voltron Data
- [Microsoft's Magpie project](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/magpie-2/), built on top of Ibis
- [SuperDuperDB](https://github.com/SuperDuperDB/superduperdb), bringing AI to any backend Ibis supports

## History

Ibis was originally created by [Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/). Wes
created pandas, co-created Apache Arrrow, and co-founded Voltron Data (among
other things). Ibis was initially a pandas-like dataframe library for Apache
Impala, but has since grown to support many other backends and mature under the
stewardship of [Phillip Cloud](https://github.com/cpcloud) and others on the
Ibis team.

The Ibis project is part of a broader composable data ecosystem envisioned by
Wes, Voltron Data, and others to solve problems seen throughout the space that
are compounding as data volume and AI complexity increase. Some good background
material on the composable data ecosystem and Ibis can be found at:

- ["Apache Arrow and the '10 Things I Hate About pandas'" by Wes](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/)
- ["The Road to Composable Data Systems: Thoughts on the Last 15 Years and the Future" by Wes](https://wesmckinney.com/blog/looking-back-15-years/)
- ["The Composable Codex" by Voltron Data](https://voltrondata.com/codex)

## Support for production workloads

Voltron Data is committed to the success of Ibis, and it's already in production
across numerous enterprises. The API is stable and while there are breaking
changes across major versions, we do our best to minimize them and provide easy
migration.

Voltron Data [offers commercial support for
Ibis](https://voltrondata.com/enterprise-support) if you're interested.
Otherwise, interacting through the open-source project channels
([GitHub](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis) and
[Zulip](https://ibis-project.zulipchat.com)) is the best way to get help.
