## From the community

From [Nick Crews on
GitHub](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/7743#issuecomment-1856391530):

> I have been very impressed with the responsiveness of the team. When I report
> bugs they are usually addressed within the next release in the next 1-2 months,
> and some feature requests of mine have been implemented with little convincing
> needed. The detailed CHANGELOG has made version transitions fairly easy, though
> there has been some bulk refactoring occasionally needed, but through the last 3
> major version upgrades I've gone through the process has never been that bad.
> Nothing but good things to say :), I hope you join along!

Zulip](https://ibis-project.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/405263-general/topic/.E2.9C.94.20ibis-on-reddit/near/407807779):

> We have a production DB2 server that is already under a heavy load. So what I've
> done was extract a subset of the data it has locally onto my machine and then
> use ibis w/duckdb backend to perform ad-hoc analysis on this local data which is
> a bit too big for pandas, instead of hammering the production server. Often
> times, I don't know what queries I'll be building or what kind of rabbit hole my
> analysis may take me. So it's great that I can just query away with my local
> data. Performance has been great.

[And later in the same
topic](https://ibis-project.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/405263-general/topic/.E2.9C.94.20ibis-on-reddit/near/407813572):

> ...I have a lot of "medium" data that I need to work with locally, and so Ibis
> has been perfect for my use cases. We have this metric called cumulative defect
> rate that I need to forecast. It requires making cumulative sums and then having
> to pivot this data, along with some wonky transformations requiring UDFs. The
> need to dynamically pivot this data is where I turn to Ibis. Love that with
> Ibis, I can use SQL for the heavy lifting or aggregations, and then being able
> to switch to dataframe-like API for the type of dynamic transformations (pivot,
> forward fill, etc) that would otherwise be tedious to do in pure SQL.

> My story around pyspark -> trying a bunch of stuff -> Ibis, which has feature of
> lazy computation.

> Our company has implemented an OLAP platform with its persistence layer on hdfs
> and the query engine being Presto. Typically, the OLAP platform is geared
> towards agile analysis, and its table structure is based on an event-driven
> model. As we delve deeper into machine learning modeling, we often need to
> transition from this event-based structure to a wide-table feature construction.

> Back between 2019 and 2020, I worked on a similar OLAP platform during my tenure
> at Tencent. I developed some generic analysis model tools, and at that time, the
> query engine was Impala. My approach was to dynamically concatenate SQL, which
> unfortunately was not conducive to code encapsulation, modularization, and
> future maintenance.

> In my pursuit of better code encapsulation and to decouple different parts of
> logic, I was initially inclined to use PySpark. However, when PySpark connects
> to Presto via JDBC, if we use the dataframe interface, the aggregation
> operations run on Spark. This doesn't harness the full power of Presto, leading
> to slow performances. On the other hand, if we use Spark's SQL interface,
> aggregation is processed on Presto. But in doing so, we lose the original intent
> of using Spark - which is better code encapsulation and the decoupling of
> different processes.

> The dataframe interface of Ibis and its feature of lazy computation perfectly
> align with my needs. In fact, back in 2019, I was on the hunt for such a tool.
> Sadly, I didn't come across Ibis at that time and even contemplated creating a
> set on my own.

> I now have catalog entries that use vanilla pyspark in my databricks environment and
> polars on my laptop which is pretty slick ðŸ”¥ Just thought I'd share since I've seen
> your team has been mentioning ibis a bit.
