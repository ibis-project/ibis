title: Backend Table Hierarchy
---

Most SQL backends organize tables into groups, and some use a two-level hierarchy.
They use terms such as `catalog`, `database`, and/or `schema` to refer to these groups.

Ibis uses the following terminology throughout its codebase, API, and documentation:

- `database`: a collection of tables
- `catalog`: a collection of databases

In other words, the full specification of a table in Ibis is either
- `catalog.database.table`
- `database.table`

Below is a table with the terminology used by each backend for the two levels of
hierarchy. This is provided as a reference, note that when using Ibis, we will
use the terms `catalog` and `database` and map them onto the appropriate fields.
