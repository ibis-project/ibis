    "In fact, some Ibis features were even inspired by similar features in the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to differences between Python and R and the design and goals of Ibis itself, you may notice some big differences right away:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No pipe:** The handy [magrittr pipe](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) (`%>%`) or R's newer native pipe (`|>`) don't exist in Python so you instead have to chain sequences of operations together with a period (`.`). The `.` in Python is analogous to R's `$` which lets you access attributes and methods on objects.\n",
    "- **No unquoted column names:** Non-standard evaluation is common in R but not present in Python. To reference a column in Ibis, you can pass a string, property on a table (e.g., `tbl.some_column`), or you can make use of [selectors](https://ibis-project.org/api/selectors/).\n",
    "- **Ibis is lazy by default:** Similar to [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) and its `collect()` method, Ibis does not evaluate our queries until we call `.to_pandas()`. For the purposes of this document, we set `ibis.options.interactive = True` which limits results to 10 rows, executes automatically, and prints a nicely-formatted table."
