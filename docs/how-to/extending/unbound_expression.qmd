title: Write and execute unbound expressions
---

One of the most powerful features of Ibis is the separation of transformation
logic from the execution engine, which allows you to "write once, execute
everywhere".

## Unbound tables

In Ibis, you can define unbound tables. An unbound table is a table with a
specified schema but not connected to a data source. You can think of it as an
empty spreadsheet with just the header. Even though the spreadsheet is empty,
you know what the data would look like.

Unbound tables allow you to write transformations for data as long as it
conforms to the provided schema. You don't need to connect to a data source
until you're ready to execute the expression and compute outputs.

## Execute an unbound expression

Here's how we can define an unbound table in Ibis:

```{python}
import ibis

schema = {
    "carat": "float64",
    "cut": "string",
    "color": "string",
    "clarity": "string",
    "depth": "float64",
    "table": "float64",
    "price": "int64",
    "x": "float64",
    "y": "float64",
    "z": "float64",
}
diamonds = ibis.table(schema, name="diamonds")
diamonds
```

So far, we have an empty `diamonds` table that contains 10 columns. Even though
there is no data in the `diamonds` table right now, we can write
transformations knowing that these are the columns available to us.

Given this table of diamonds of various carats, cuts, and colors, we're
interested in learning the average carat for each color of premium and ideal
diamonds. In order to do this, we can first calculate the average carat for
each color and cut of diamonds, then make a pivot table to show the results:

```{python}
from ibis import _

expr = (
    diamonds.group_by(["cut", "color"])
    .agg(carat=_.carat.mean())
    .pivot_wider(
        names=("Premium", "Ideal"), names_from="cut", values_from="carat", names_sort=True, values_agg="mean"
    )
)
```

Now that we're ready to compute results, we can connect to any of Ibis'
supported backends. This feature logic can be reused and you don't need to
modify it again!

This is a dataset that we can process locally. Let's connect to DuckDB and load
the data into a DuckDB table:

```{python}
parquet_dir = "diamonds.parquet"

# download data into a local file
ibis.examples.diamonds.fetch().to_parquet(parquet_dir)
con = ibis.duckdb.connect()
con.read_parquet(parquet_dir, table_name="diamonds")
```

Connecting to this DuckDB table and executing the transformation on the loaded
data is now as simple as

```{python}
con.to_pandas(expr)
```

Voil√†!

If you want to continue to work with the data in DuckDB, you can create a new
table and insert the outputs into it like so:

```{python}
output_schema = ibis.schema(
    {
        "color": "string",
        "Ideal": "float64",
        "Premium": "float64",
    }
)
con.create_table("results", schema=output_schema)
con.insert("results", expr)

con.table("results").to_pandas()
```

## Execute on another backend

Because Ibis separates the transformation logic from the execution engine, you
can easily reuse the written transformation for another backend. Here we use
Polars as an example, but you can do the same for any of Ibis' 20+ supported
backends as long as that particular backend supports the operations
(see [the operation support matrix](../../backends/support/matrix.qmd)).

```{python}
pl = ibis.polars.connect()
pl.read_parquet(parquet_dir, table_name="diamonds")
pl.to_pandas(expr)
```
