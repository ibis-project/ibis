# Basic input/output

If you don't have your own data, you can load example data from the `ibis.examples` module:

```{python}
import ibis
import ibis.selectors as s

ibis.options.interactive = True

t = ibis.examples.penguins.fetch()
```

## Overview

Ibis is typically used with a backend that already contains tables, but can import and export data in various formats.
