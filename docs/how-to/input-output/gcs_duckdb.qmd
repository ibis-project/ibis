title: Loading Google Cloud Storage files with DuckDB
---

Loading data stored on Google Cloud Storage to DuckDB requires specifying `gcs` as filesystem.

```
from ibis.interactive import *

con = ibis.duckdb.connect()

import fsspec
import gcsfs

gcs = fsspec.filesystem("gcs")

con.register_filesystem(gcs)

t = con.read_json(<URL>)
```

Where `<URL>` is the url provided by GCS. Note that:
- For private files use the URL with prefix `gs://` 
- For public files you can use the URL with prefix `gcs://`
