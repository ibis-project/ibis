# Style and formatting

## Code style

Ibis uses several code linters, like [`ruff`](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff), [`shellcheck`](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck), [`statix`](https://github.com/nerdypepper/statix), [`nixpkgs-fmt`](https://github.com/nix-community/nixpkgs-fmt) and others, that are enforced by CI. Developers should run them locally before submitting a PR.

1. Install `pre-commit`

```sh
pip install pre-commit
```

2. Run

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```
::: {.callout-note}
Some of the packages needed to run the `pre-commit` linting can not be installed automatically (e.g. `prettier`, `actionlint`, `shellcheck`), and they need to be installed through a system package manager.
:::

Optionally, you may want to setup the `pre-commit` hooks to run automatically when making a git commit. To do this, run the following from the root of the Ibis repository:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

This will run the code linters automatically when you make a git commit. If you want to skip these checks, do `git commit --no-verify`


::: {.callout-tip}
If you use `nix-shell`, all of these are already setup for you and ready to use, and you don't need to do anything to install these tools.
