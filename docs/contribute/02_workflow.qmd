title: "Contribute to the Ibis codebase"
---

## Workflow

### Getting started

First, set up a [development environment](./01_environment.qmd).

If you're developing on Mac M1 or M2, see [docs for setting up Colima](#set-up-colima).

### Taking issues

If you find an issue you want to work on, write a comment with the text
`/take` on the issue. GitHub will then assign the issue to you.

### Running the test suite

To run tests that do not require a backend:

```sh
pytest -m core
```

#### Backend test suites

::: {.callout-tip}
## You may be able to skip this section

If you haven't made changes to the core of ibis (e.g., `ibis/expr`) or any
specific backends (`ibis/backends`) this material isn't necessary to
follow to make a pull request. You can jump directly to the
[Writing the commit](#writing-the-commit) section
:::

First, we need to download example data to run the tests successfully:

```sh
just download-data
```

To run the tests for a specific backend (e.g. sqlite):

```sh
pytest -m sqlite
```

### Setting up non-trivial backends

::: {.callout-note}
## MacOS users on arm64 CPUs must use a different setup

If you are working with an `arm64` architecture (Mac M1/M2) you can setup Docker
with [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima). Refer to
[set up colima](#set-up-colima). Or you can download Docker desktop.
:::

These client-server backends need to be started before testing them.
They can be started with `docker compose` directly, or using the `just` tool.

- ClickHouse: `just up clickhouse`
- Exasol: `just up exasol` (no `arm64` support)
- Flink: `just up flink`
- Impala: `just up impala`
- SQL Server: `just up mssql`
- MySQL: `just up mysql`
- Oracle: `just up oracle`
- PostgreSQL: `just up postgres`
- RisingWave: `just up risingwave`
- Trino: `just up trino`
- Druid: `just up druid`

and then run the test suite for the backend you just started. For example,
if you ran `just up postgres`:

```sh
pytest -m postgres
```

#### Test the backend locally

If anything seems amiss with a backend, you can of course test it locally:

```sh
export PGPASSWORD=postgres
psql -t -A -h localhost -U postgres -d ibis_testing -c "select 'success'"
```

#### Adding appropriate tests

If you pull request involves a new feature, you should add appropriate tests to cover
all ordinary and edge cases.

Pytest markers can be used to assert that a test should fail or raise a specific error.
We use a number of pytest markers in ibis:

- `pytest.mark.notimpl`: the backend can do a thing, we haven't mapped the op
- `pytest.mark.notyet`: the backend cannot do a thing, but might in the future
- `pytest.mark.never`: the backend will never support this / pass this test (common example
here is a test running on sqlite that relies on strong typing)
- `pytest.mark.broken`: this test broke and it's demonstrably unrelated to the PR I'm working
on and fixing it shouldn't block this PR from going in (but we should fix it up pronto)

Refrain from using a generic marker like `pytest.mark.xfail`.


### Writing the commit

Ibis follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) structure.
In brief, the commit summary should look like:

    fix(types): make all floats doubles

The type (e.g. `fix`) can be:

- `fix`: A bug fix. Correlates with PATCH in SemVer
- `feat`: A new feature. Correlates with MINOR in SemVer
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  `
  If the commit fixes a Github issue, add something like this to the bottom of the description:

      fixes #4242

### Submit a pull request

Ibis follows the standard GitHub pull request process. The team will review the PR and merge when it's ready.

## Colima setup for Mac M1/M2 users {#set-up-colima}

[Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) is a container runtime that
supports Mac M1 and M2 CPUs.

If you are working with an M1 or M2 CPU architecture, you will need to
run Docker to be able to test some backends supported by Ibis. With Colima[^1],
you can run Docker on newer Macs without using Docker Desktop[^2].

[^1]: [Installing Colima as a Docker Engine provider with `buildx` and `compose` plugins installed](https://aosolorzano.medium.com/installing-colima-as-a-docker-engine-provider-with-buildx-and-compose-plugins-installed-1ce8b3bae158)
[^2]: [Goodbye Docker Desktop for Mac, Hello Colima](https://jacobtomlinson.dev/posts/2022/goodbye-docker-desktop-for-mac-hello-colima/)

### Get started

#### Uninstall Docker Desktop

If you have Docker desktop installed, follow [^1] or [^2], both of them have
a section on how to uninstall Docker Desktop.

#### Install Docker client with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Make sure your Homebrew installation is up to date.

```bash
$ brew install docker
```

#### Check installation by running

```bash
$ docker --version
```

Notice we haven't installed any Docker Engine yet, and only the Docker client
information is displayed.

#### Install Colima

```bash
$ brew install colima
```

#### Install Docker Compose plugin (optional)

If you want to be able to run `docker compose` or run `just up`, follow these
steps.

The official [Docker
documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) suggests
running the following commands in a separate terminal:

Replace the link on the `curl` step with the version you desired, find them here
https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/

```bash
$ DOCKER_CONFIG=${DOCKER_CONFIG:-$HOME/.docker}
$ mkdir -p $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins
$ curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.24.6/docker-compose-darwin-aarch64 -o $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

Then add execution permission to the downloaded binary:

```bash
$ chmod +x $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

Check it worked:

```bash
$ docker compose version
```

#### Start Colima

```bash
$ colima start
```

You can now run `docker version` and you will see the engine.

::: {.callout-note}
## By default this launches containers with 2 CPUs, 2GB of RAM, and 60GB of disk space.

You can modify this as well as the architecture by passing command line
arguments (`--cpu`, `--memory`, `--disk`, and `--arch`) to `colima start`.
:::

```bash
$ colima status
$ colima list
```

In your Ibis clone

```bash
$ just up postgres
```

Once the `just` command finishes, you can run the tests by doing:

```bash
$ pytest -m postgres
```

Once you are done, you can stop the container by doing:

```bash
$ just down postgres
```

If you are done for the day, and want to avoid the Colima instance eating your
resources, you will want to stop it.

```bash
$ colima stop
```

If you upgraded colima, you need to delete the existing instance. If you want to
modify the allocation, you need to delete the existing instance too (unless
you are going only up).

```bash
$ colima delete
```
