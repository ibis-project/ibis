# Automated Code and AI

::: {.callout-note}
The wording and general tone of this policy is taken from [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/#automated-code-and-ai)
:::

You are encouraged to use all the tools you want to do your work and contribute
as efficiently as possible, this includes AI (LLM) tools, etc. Nevertheless,
contributions should have meaningful human intervention, judgement, context,
etc.

If the *human effort* put in a PR, e.g. writing LLM prompts, is *less* than *the
effort we would need to put to review it*, please don't submit the PR.

Think of it this way: we can already write LLM prompts or run automated tools
ourselves, and that would be faster than reviewing external PRs.

## Closing Automated and AI PRs

If we see PRs that seem AI generated or automated in similar ways, we'll flag
them and close them.

The same applies to comments and descriptions, please don't copy paste the
content generated by an LLM.

## Human Effort Denial of Service

Using automated tools and AI to submit PRs or comments that we have to carefully
review and handle would be the equivalent of a Denial-of-service attack on our
human effort.

It would be very little effort from the person submitting the PR (an LLM prompt)
that generates a large amount of effort on our side (carefully reviewing code).

Please don't do that.

We'll need to block accounts that spam us with repeated automated PRs or comments.
