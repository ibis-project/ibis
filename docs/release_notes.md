## Support

* Improvement of the backend API. The former `Client` subclasses have been replaced by a `Backend` class that must subclass `ibis.backends.base.BaseBackend`. The `BaseBackend` class contains abstract methods for the minimum subset of methods that backends must implement, and their signatures have been standardized across backends. The Ibis compiler has been refactored, and backends don't need to implement all compiler classes anymore if the default works for them. Only a subclass of `ibis.backends.base.sql.compiler.Compiler` is now required. Backends now need to register themselves as entry points. ([#2678](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2678))
* Deprecate `exists_table(table)` in favor of `table in list_tables()` ([#2905](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2905))
* Remove handwritten type parser; parsing errors that were previously `IbisTypeError` are now `parsy.ParseError`. `parsy` is now a hard requirement. ([#2977](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2977))
* Methods `current_database` and `list_databases` raise an exception for backends that do not support databases ([#2962](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2962))
* Method `set_database` has been deprecated, in favor of creating a new connection to a different database ([#2913](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2913))
* Removed `log` method of clients, in favor of `verbose_log` option ([#2914](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2914))
* Output of `Client.version` returned as a string, instead of a setuptools `Version` ([#2883](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2883))
* Deprecated `list_schemas` in SQLAlchemy backends in favor of `list_databases` ([#2862](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2862))
* Deprecated `ibis.<backend>.verify()` in favor of capturing exception in `ibis.<backend>.compile()` ([#2865](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2865))
* Simplification of data fetching. Backends don't need to implement `Query` anymore ([#2789](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2789))
* Move BigQuery backend to a `separate repository <https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis-bigquery>`_. The backend will be released separately, use `pip install ibis-bigquery` or `conda install ibis-bigquery` to install it, and then use as before. ([#2665](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2665))
* Supporting SQLAlchemy 1.4, and requiring minimum 1.3 ([#2689](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2689))
* Namespace time_col config, fix type check for trim_with_timecontext for pandas window execution ([#2680](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2680))
* Remove deprecated `ibis.HDFS`, `ibis.WebHDFS` and `ibis.hdfs_connect` ([#2505](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/2505))

# 0.8 (2016-05-19)

This release brings initial PostgreSQL backend support along with a
number of critical bug fixes and usability improvements. As several
correctness bugs with the SQL compiler were fixed, we recommend that all
users upgrade from earlier versions of Ibis.

## New Features

-   Initial PostgreSQL backend contributed by Phillip Cloud.
-   Add `groupby` as an alias for `group_by` to table expressions

## Bug Fixes

-   Fix an expression error when filtering based on a new field
-   Fix Impala\'s SQL compilation of using `OR` with compound filters
-   Various fixes with the `having(...)` function in grouped table
    expressions
-   Fix CTE (`WITH`) extraction inside `UNION ALL` expressions.
-   Fix `ImportError` on Python 2 when `mock` library not installed

## API Changes

-   The deprecated `ibis.impala_connect` and `ibis.make_client` APIs
    have been removed

# 0.7 (2016-03-16)

This release brings initial Kudu-Impala integration and improved Impala
and SQLite support, along with several critical bug fixes.

## New Features

-   Apache Kudu (incubating) integration for Impala users. See the [blog
    post](http://blog.ibis-project.org/kudu-impala-ibis) for now. Will
    add some documentation here when possible.
-   Add `use_https` option to `ibis.hdfs_connect` for WebHDFS
    connections in secure (Kerberized) clusters without SSL enabled.
-   Correctly compile aggregate expressions involving multiple
    subqueries.

To explain this last point in more detail, suppose you had:

``` python
table = ibis.table([('flag', 'string'),
                    ('value', 'double')],
                   'tbl')

flagged = table[table.flag == '1']
unflagged = table[table.flag == '0']

fv = flagged.value
uv = unflagged.value

expr = (fv.mean() / fv.sum()) - (uv.mean() / uv.sum())
```

The last expression now generates the correct Impala or SQLite SQL:

``` sql
SELECT t0.`tmp` - t1.`tmp` AS `tmp`
FROM (
  SELECT avg(`value`) / sum(`value`) AS `tmp`
  FROM tbl
  WHERE `flag` = '1'
) t0
  CROSS JOIN (
    SELECT avg(`value`) / sum(`value`) AS `tmp`
    FROM tbl
    WHERE `flag` = '0'
  ) t1
```

## Bug Fixes

-   `CHAR(n)` and `VARCHAR(n)` Impala types now correctly map to Ibis
    string expressions
-   Fix inappropriate projection-join-filter expression rewrites
    resulting in incorrect generated SQL.
-   `ImpalaClient.create_table` correctly passes `STORED AS PARQUET` for
    `format='parquet'`.
-   Fixed several issues with Ibis dependencies (impyla, thriftpy, sasl,
    thrift_sasl), especially for secure clusters. Upgrading will pull in
    these new dependencies.
-   Do not fail in `ibis.impala.connect` when trying to create the
    temporary Ibis database if no HDFS connection passed.
-   Fix join predicate evaluation bug when column names overlap with
    table attributes.
-   Fix handling of fully-materialized joins (aka `select *` joins) in
    SQLAlchemy / SQLite.

    these things.
    -   Improved Impala-pandas integration. Create tables or insert into
        existing tables from pandas `DataFrame` objects.
    -   Partitioned table metadata management API. Add, drop, alter, and
        insert into table partitions.
    -   Add `is_partitioned` property to `ImpalaTable`.
    -   Added support for `LOAD DATA` DDL using the `load_data`
        function, also supporting partitioned tables.
    -   Modify table metadata (location, format, SerDe properties etc.)
        using `ImpalaTable.alter`
    -   Interrupting Impala expression execution with Control-C will
        attempt to cancel the running query with the server.
    -   Set the compression codec (e.g. snappy) used with
        `ImpalaClient.set_compression_codec`.
    -   Get and set query options for a client session with
        `ImpalaClient.get_options` and `ImpalaClient.set_options`.
    -   Add `ImpalaTable.metadata` method that parses the output of the
        `DESCRIBE FORMATTED` DDL to simplify table metadata inspection.
    -   Add `ImpalaTable.stats` and `ImpalaTable.column_stats` to see
        computed table and partition statistics.
    -   Add `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` handling
    -   Add `refresh`, `invalidate_metadata` DDL options and add
        `incremental` option to `compute_stats` for
        `COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS`.
-   Add `substitute` method for performing multiple value substitutions
    in an array or scalar expression.
-   Division is by default *true division* like Python 3 for all numeric
    data. This means for SQL systems that use C-style division
    semantics, the appropriate `CAST` will be automatically inserted in
    the generated SQL.
-   Easier joins on tables with overlapping column names. See `Ibis for SQL Programmers`.
-   Expressions like `string_expr[:3]` now work as expected.
-   Add `coalesce` instance method to all value expressions.
-   Passing `limit=None` to the `execute` method on expressions disables
    any default row limits.

## API Changes

-   `ImpalaTable.rename` no longer mutates the calling table expression.

# 0.5 (2015-09-10)

Highlights in this release are the SQLite, Python 3, Impala UDA support,
and an asynchronous execution API. There are also many usability
improvements, bug fixes, and other new features.

## New Features

-   SQLite client and built-in function support
-   Ibis now supports Python 3.4 as well as 2.6 and 2.7
-   Ibis can utilize Impala user-defined aggregate (UDA) functions
-   SQLAlchemy-based translation toolchain to enable more SQL engines
    having SQLAlchemy dialects to be supported
-   Many window function usability improvements (nested analytic
    functions and deferred binding conveniences)
-   More convenient aggregation with keyword arguments in `aggregate`
    functions
-   Built preliminary wrapper API for MADLib-on-Impala
-   Add `var` and `std` aggregation methods and support in Impala
-   Add `nullifzero` numeric method for all SQL engines
-   Add `rename` method to Impala tables (for renaming tables in the
    Hive metastore)
-   Add `close` method to `ImpalaClient` for session cleanup (#533)
-   Add `relabel` method to table expressions
-   Add `insert` method to Impala tables
-   Add `compile` and `verify` methods to all expressions to test
    compilation and ability to compile (since many operations are
    unavailable in SQLite, for example)

## API Changes

-   Impala Ibis client creation now uses only `ibis.impala.connect`, and
    `ibis.make_client` has been deprecated

# 0.4 (2015-08-14)

## New Features

-   Add tooling to use Impala C++ scalar UDFs within Ibis (#262, #195)
-   Support and testing for Kerberos-enabled secure HDFS clusters
-   Many table functions can now accept functions as parameters (invoked
    on the calling table) to enhance composability and emulate
    late-binding semantics of languages (like R) that have non-standard
    evaluation (#460)
-   Add `any`, `all`, `notany`, and `notall` reductions on boolean
    arrays, as well as `cumany` and `cumall`
-   Using `topk` now produces an analytic expression that is executable
    (as an aggregation) but can also be used as a filter as before
    (#392, #91)
-   Added experimental database object \"usability layer\", see
    `ImpalaClient.database`.
-   Add `TableExpr.info`
-   Add `compute_stats` API to table expressions referencing physical
    Impala tables
-   Add `explain` method to `ImpalaClient` to show query plan for an
    expression
-   Add `chmod` and `chown` APIs to `HDFS` interface for superusers
-   Add `convert_base` method to strings and integer types
-   Add option to `ImpalaClient.create_table` to create empty
    partitioned tables
-   `ibis.cross_join` can now join more than 2 tables at once
-   Add `ImpalaClient.raw_sql` method for running naked SQL queries
-   `ImpalaClient.insert` now validates schemas locally prior to sending
    query to cluster, for better usability.
-   Add conda installation recipes

# 0.3 (2015-07-20)

First public release. See <http://ibis-project.org> for more.

## New Features

-   Implement window / analytic function support
-   Enable non-equijoins (join clauses with operations other than `==`).
-   Add remaining `string functions` supported by Impala.
-   Add `pipe` method to tables (hat-tip to the pandas dev team).
-   Add `mutate` convenience method to tables.
-   Fleshed out `WebHDFS` implementations: get/put directories, move
    files, etc. See the `full HDFS API`.
-   Add `truncate` method for timestamp values
-   `ImpalaClient` can execute scalar expressions not involving any
    table.
-   Can also create internal Impala tables with a specific HDFS path.
-   Make Ibis\'s temporary Impala database and HDFS paths configurable
    (see `ibis.options`).
-   Add `truncate_table` function to client (if the user\'s Impala
    cluster supports it).
-   Python 2.6 compatibility
-   Enable Ibis to execute concurrent queries in multithreaded
    applications (earlier versions were not thread-safe).
-   Test data load script in `scripts/load_test_data.py`
-   Add an internal operation type signature API to enhance developer
    productivity.
