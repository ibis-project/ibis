Clone the Repository
--------------------
To contribute to ibis you need to clone the repository from GitHub:

.. code-block:: sh

   git clone https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis

Set Up a Development Environment
--------------------------------
#. `Install miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_
#. Create a conda environment suitable for ibis development:

   .. code-block:: sh

      conda env create -n ibis-dev --file ci/requirements-3.7-dev.yml

#. Activate the environment

   .. code-block:: sh

      conda activate ibis-dev

Run the Test Suite
------------------

Contributor `Krisztián Szűcs <https://github.com/kszucs>`_ has spent many hours
crafting an easy-to-use `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_
setup that enables ibis developers to get up and running quickly.

For those unfamiliar with ``docker``, and ``docker-compose``, here are some
rough steps on how to get things set up:

    - Install ``docker-compose`` with ``pip install docker-compose``
    - Install `docker <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_

      - Be sure to follow the
        `post-install instructions
        <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/>`_
        if you are running on Linux.


Here are the steps to start database services and run the test suite:

.. code-block:: sh

   make --directory ibis init
   make --directory ibis testparallel
