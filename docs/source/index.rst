Ibis Documentation
==================

Ibis is a Python big data framework. To learn more about Ibis's vision and
roadmap, please visit http://ibis-project.org.

Source code is on GitHub: http://github.com/cloudera/ibis

Since this is a young project, the documentation is definitely patchy in
places, but this will improve as things progress.
