Release Notes
=============

    **Note**: These release notes will only include notable or major bug fixes
    since most minor bug fixes tend to be esoteric and not generally
    interesting. Point (minor, e.g. 0.5.1) releases will generally not be found
    here and contain only bug fixes.

0.8 (Not yet released)
----------------------

This release brings initial PostgreSQL backend support along with a number of
critical bug fixes and usability improvements. As several correctness bugs with
the SQL compiler were fixed, we recommend that all users upgrade from earlier
versions of Ibis.

0.7 (March 16, 2016)
--------------------

This release brings initial Kudu-Impala integration and improved Impala and
SQLite support, along with several critical bug fixes.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Apache Kudu (incubating) integration for Impala users. See the `blog post <http://blog.ibis-project.org/kudu-impala-ibis>`_ for now. Will add some documentation here when possible.
* Add ``use_https`` option to ``ibis.hdfs_connect`` for WebHDFS connections in
  secure (Kerberized) clusters without SSL enabled.
* Correctly compile aggregate expressions involving multiple subqueries.

To explain this last point in more detail, suppose you had:

.. code-block:: python

   table = ibis.table([('flag', 'string'),
                       ('value', 'double')],
                      'tbl')

   flagged = table[table.flag == '1']
   unflagged = table[table.flag == '0']

   fv = flagged.value
   uv = unflagged.value

   expr = (fv.mean() / fv.sum()) - (uv.mean() / uv.sum())

The last expression now generates the correct Impala or SQLite SQL:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT t0.`tmp` - t1.`tmp` AS `tmp`
   FROM (
     SELECT avg(`value`) / sum(`value`) AS `tmp`
     FROM tbl
     WHERE `flag` = '1'
   ) t0
     CROSS JOIN (
       SELECT avg(`value`) / sum(`value`) AS `tmp`
       FROM tbl
       WHERE `flag` = '0'
     ) t1

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* ``CHAR(n)`` and ``VARCHAR(n)`` Impala types now correctly map to Ibis string
  expressions
* Fix inappropriate projection-join-filter expression rewrites resulting in
  incorrect generated SQL.
* ``ImpalaClient.create_table`` correctly passes ``STORED AS PARQUET`` for
  ``format='parquet'``.
* Fixed several issues with Ibis dependencies (impyla, thriftpy, sasl,
  thrift_sasl), especially for secure clusters. Upgrading will pull in these
  new dependencies.
* Do not fail in ``ibis.impala.connect`` when trying to create the temporary
  Ibis database if no HDFS connection passed.
* Fix join predicate evaluation bug when column names overlap with table
  attributes.
* Fix handling of fully-materialized joins (aka ``select *`` joins) in
  SQLAlchemy / SQLite.

0.6 (December 1, 2015)
----------------------

This release brings expanded pandas and Impala integration, including support
for managing partitioned tables in Impala. See the new :ref:`Ibis for Impala
Users <impala>` guide for more on using Ibis with Impala.

The :ref:`Ibis for SQL Programmers <sql>` guide also was written since the 0.5
release.

This release also includes bug fixes affecting generated SQL correctness. All
users should upgrade as soon as possible.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* New integrated Impala functionality. See :ref:`Ibis for Impala Users
  <impala>` for more details on these things.

  * Improved Impala-pandas integration. Create tables or insert into existing
    tables from pandas ``DataFrame`` objects.
  * Partitioned table metadata management API. Add, drop, alter, and
    insert into table partitions.
  * Add ``is_partitioned`` property to ``ImpalaTable``.
  * Added support for ``LOAD DATA`` DDL using the ``load_data`` function, also
    supporting partitioned tables.
  * Modify table metadata (location, format, SerDe properties etc.)  using
    ``ImpalaTable.alter``
  * Interrupting Impala expression execution with Control-C will attempt to
    cancel the running query with the server.
  * Set the compression codec (e.g. snappy) used with
    ``ImpalaClient.set_compression_codec``.
  * Get and set query options for a client session with
    ``ImpalaClient.get_options`` and ``ImpalaClient.set_options``.
  * Add ``ImpalaTable.metadata`` method that parses the output of the
    ``DESCRIBE FORMATTED`` DDL to simplify table metadata inspection.
  * Add ``ImpalaTable.stats`` and ``ImpalaTable.column_stats`` to see computed
    table and partition statistics.
  * Add ``CHAR`` and ``VARCHAR`` handling
  * Add ``refresh``, ``invalidate_metadata`` DDL options and add
    ``incremental`` option to ``compute_stats`` for ``COMPUTE INCREMENTAL
    STATS``.

* Add ``substitute`` method for performing multiple value substitutions in an
  array or scalar expression.
* Division is by default *true division* like Python 3 for all numeric
  data. This means for SQL systems that use C-style division semantics, the
  appropriate ``CAST`` will be automatically inserted in the generated SQL.
* Easier joins on tables with overlapping column names. See :ref:`Ibis for SQL Programmers <sql>`.
* Expressions like ``string_expr[:3]`` now work as expected.
* Add ``coalesce`` instance method to all value expressions.
* Passing ``limit=None`` to the ``execute`` method on expressions disables any
  default row limits.

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``ImpalaTable.rename`` no longer mutates the calling table expression.

0.5 (September 10, 2015)
------------------------

Highlights in this release are the SQLite, Python 3, Impala UDA support, and an
asynchronous execution API. There are also many usability improvements, bug
fixes, and other new features.

* SQLite client and built-in function support
* Ibis now supports Python 3.4 as well as 2.6 and 2.7
* Ibis can utilize Impala user-defined aggregate (UDA) functions

  SQLAlchemy dialects to be supported
* Many window function usability improvements (nested analytic functions and
  deferred binding conveniences)
* More convenient aggregation with keyword arguments in ``aggregate`` functions
* Built preliminary wrapper API for MADLib-on-Impala
* Add ``var`` and ``std`` aggregation methods and support in Impala

* Add ``relabel`` method to table expressions
* Add ``insert`` method to Impala tables
* Add ``compile`` and ``verify`` methods to all expressions to test compilation
  and ability to compile (since many operations are unavailable in SQLite, for
  example)

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Impala Ibis client creation now uses only ``ibis.impala.connect``, and
  ``ibis.make_client`` has been deprecated
