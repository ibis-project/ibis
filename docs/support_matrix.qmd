# Operation support matrix

::: {.callout-tip}
Backends with low coverage are good places to start contributing!

Each backend implements operations differently, but this is usually very similar to other backends. If you want to start contributing to ibis, it's a good idea to start by adding missing operations to backends that have low operation coverage.

This app is built using [`streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/).

You can develop the app locally by editing `docs/backends/app/backend_info_app.py` and opening a PR with your changes.

Test your changes locally by running

```sh
$ streamlit run docs/backends/app/backend_info_app.py
```

The changes will show up in the dev docs when your PR is merged!

## Raw Data

```{python}
#| echo: false
!python ../gen_matrix.py
```

You can also download data from the above tables in [CSV format](./raw_support_matrix.csv).

The code used to generate the linked CSV file is below.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
with open("../gen_matrix.py", mode="r") as f:
    print(f"```python\n{f.read()}\n```")
```
