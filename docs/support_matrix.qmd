::: {.card title="Welcome to the operation support matrix!"}

This is a [Quarto dashboard](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/) that shows
the operations each backend supports.

Due to differences in SQL dialects and upstream support for different
operations in different backends, support for the full breadth of the Ibis API
varies.

::: {.callout-tip}
Backends with low coverage are good places to start contributing!

Each backend implements operations differently, but this is usually very similar to other backends. If you want to start contributing to ibis, it's a good idea to start by adding missing operations to backends that have low operation coverage.
