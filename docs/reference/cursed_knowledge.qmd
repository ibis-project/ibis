# Cursed Knowledge

Cursed knowledge the Ibis developers have acquired via battling with many, many
execution engines.

## Oracle

* Oracle's `LTRIM` and `RTRIM` functions accept a _set_ of whitespace (or other)
  characters to remove from the left-, and right-hand-side sides of the input
  string, but the `TRIM` function only accepts a single character to remove.

## Impala

* Impala's `LTRIM` and `RTRIM` functions accept a _set_ of whitespace (or other)
  characters to remove from the left-, and right-hand-side sides of the input
  string, but the `TRIM` function only removes _spaces_.
