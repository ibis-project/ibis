# Getting started

## Installation instructions

Here's the recommended way of installing {{ config.project_name }}.

1. Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) for your operating system and
   the latest Python version, run the installer, and follow the steps. Detailed instructions
   on how to install Anaconda can be found in the
   [Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)).

2. In a shell prompt install `ibis-framework`:

   ```sh
   conda install -c conda-forge ibis-framework
   ```

3. In the same shell, import ibis and print its version

   ```sh
   python -c 'import ibis; print(ibis.__version__)'
   ```

4. You're ready to start using {{ config.project_name }}!
