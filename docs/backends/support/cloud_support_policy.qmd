# Cloud backend support policy

Ibis supports a number of proprietary cloud backends.

Snowflake and Databricks cost money to test in our continuous integration test suite.

If funding dries up, support for these backends will become best effort.

If you're interested in ensuring continued support for a cloud backend, please
consider sponsoring Ibis development.

The cost at the time of writing (2024-10-31) is about **$5,000 USD per year**
split evenly between the Snowflake and Databricks backend.

Google has very generously supported the entire cost of testing the BigQuery
backend for a number of years.
