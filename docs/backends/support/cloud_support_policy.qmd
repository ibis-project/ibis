# Cloud backend support policy

Ibis supports and tests some of the major proprietary cloud backends:

- Google BigQuery
- Snowflake
- Databricks Cloud
- Amazon Athena

**All of these services cost money to run in our continuous integration test suite.**

If funding for these services dries up, support for these backends will move to
best effort.

If you or your company are interested in ensuring continued maintenance for one
of these backends, please get in touch with us on
[Zulip](https://ibis-project.zulipchat.com/), or [open a GitHub
issue](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/new) and consider sponsoring
Ibis development.

## Current cost estimates

- Google BigQuery: free, donated very generously by Google
- Snowflake: $2500 USD per year
- Databricks Cloud: $2500 USD per year
- Amazon Athena: ?
