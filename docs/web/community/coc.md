# Code of Conduct

Ibis is governed by the
[NumFOCUS code of conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct),
which in a short version is:

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally.
Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not
appropriate for {{ ibis.project_name }}.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
imagery is not appropriate.

{{ ibis.project_name }} is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and expression,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.
