# Supported Python Versions

Ibis follows [NEP29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)
with respect to supported Python versions.

This has been in-place [since Ibis version 3.0.0](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/blob/5015677d78909473014a61725d371b4bf772cdff/docs/blog/Ibis-version-3.0.0-release.md?plain=1#L83).

The [support
table](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#support-table)
shows the schedule for dropping support for Python versions.

The next major release of Ibis that occurs on or after the NEP29 drop date
removes support for the specified Python version.
