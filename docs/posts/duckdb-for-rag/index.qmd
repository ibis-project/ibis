## Overview

In this post, we'll demonstrate traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
with DuckDB and OpenAI via Ibis and discuss the pros and cons. Notice that
because Ibis is portable, you can use (almost) any database Ibis supports for
RAG!

::: {.callout-tip title="Which databases can I use?"}
The database must support array types and have some form of similarity metric
between arrays of numbers. Alternatively, a custom user-defined function (UDF)
can be used for the similarity metric.
:::

[DuckDB is the default backend for Ibis](../why-duckdb/index.qmd) and makes
rapid prototyping locally very easy. You can deploy it to
[MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com) just by changing the connection string, or
swap out DuckDB for another Ibis backend.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique for language model systems
to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base, augment the model's
input with that knowledge, and then generate a response. It serves to provide
useful context given language models' context length limitations and increase
the quality of the response.

::: {.callout-note title="Is RAG dead?"}
With increasing language model context lengths, is RAG dead?

**No**. Though as we'll discuss later, it's unclear if traditional vector
similarity search RAG is the best approach. Regardless, just because a language
model can use the entire content of a textbook doesn't mean you'll get better
performance (accuracy or efficiency) than first retrieving the relevant subsets
of the textbook.
:::

Traditional RAG embeds text into vectors of numbers and then computes a
similarity metric between input text and the knowledge base to determine the
most relevant context.

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    style T fill:#1E90FF,stroke:#1E90FF,color:#ffffff
    style N fill:#1E90FF,stroke:#1E90FF,color:#ffffff
    style C fill:#1E90FF,stroke:#1E90FF,color:#ffffff

    T("text") --> N("numbers (embedding vector)")
    N --> C("compute similarity metric")
```

Let's jump into the code!

## RAG over Ibis documentation

We'll use the Ibis documentation as our knowledge base.

### Setup code

First we need to install and import the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install 'ibis-framework[duckdb]' openai python-dotenv
```

```{python}
import os  # <1>
import ibis
import shutil
import subprocess

from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pathlib import Path  # <1>
```

1. Import the libraries we'll use.

We need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to our OpenAI API key.
Do this by creating a `.env` file in the same directory as the code and adding
the following line:

```txt
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>  # <1>
```

1. Replace with your OpenAI API key.

Then load the environment variables:

```{python}
load_dotenv()  # <1>
```

1. Load environment variables from the `.env` file.

Now we're ready to make OpenAI calls.

Let's also setup Ibis for interactive use:

```{python}
ibis.options.interactive = True  # <1>
```

1. Turn on Ibis interactive mode.

### Getting the data into DuckDB

We'll use a function to clone a given repository:

```{python}
def clone_repo(repo_url):  # <1>
    subprocess.run(["git", "clone", "--depth", "1", repo_url], check=False)  # <1>
```

1. Define a function to clone a repository.

Let's clone `ibis` and prepare to ingest all the Quarto markdown files into a
DuckDB database called `rag.ddb`:

```{python}
org_url = "https://github.com/ibis-project"  # <1>
repo_name = "ibis"  # <1>

shutil.rmtree(repo_name, ignore_errors=True)  # <2>
clone_repo(f"{org_url}/{repo_name}")  # <3>

if os.path.exists("rag.ddb"):  # <4>
    os.remove("rag.ddb")
if os.path.exists("rag.ddb.wal"):
    os.remove("rag.ddb.wal")  # <4>

rag_con = ibis.connect("duckdb://rag.ddb")  # <5>
rag_con.list_tables()  # <6>
```

1. Setup the repository to clone.
2. Remove the repository if it exists to ensure a fresh clone.
3. Clone the repository.
4. Remove the DuckDB database if it exists to ensure a fresh database.
5. Connect to the DuckDB database.
6. List the tables in the database, showing it is empty.

We'll walk through all the cloned files. For `.qmd` files, read the contents and
insert them into the `ibis` table:

```{python}
for filepath in Path(repo_name).rglob("*.qmd"):  # <1>
    contents = filepath.read_text()  # <2>

    data = {"filepath": [str(filepath)], "contents": [contents]}  # <3>

    t = ibis.memtable(data)  # <4>

    if repo_name not in rag_con.list_tables():  # <5>
        rag_con.create_table(repo_name, t)  # <5>
    else:  # <6>
        rag_con.insert(repo_name, t)  # <6>

for table in rag_con.list_tables():  # <7>
    if "memtable" in table:  # <7>
        rag_con.drop_view(table)  # <7>

rag_con.list_tables()  # <8>
```

1. Walk through all the Quarto markdown files in the repository.
2. Read the contents of the file.
3. Create a dictionary with the file path and contents.
4. Create an Ibis memtable from the dictionary.
5. If the table doesn't exist, create it with the memtable.
6. Otherwise, insert the memtable into the table.
7. Drop any memtables.
8. List the tables in the database to show the `ibis` table.

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: false
# this is here to avoid building all the docs in this post...
_ = shutil.rmtree(repo_name, ignore_errors=True)
```

Let's inspect the table:

```{python}
t = rag_con.table(repo_name)  # <1>
t
```

1. Get the `ibis` table from the DuckDB database.

Now we have a DuckDB database with the `ibis` table containing all the file
paths and contents of the Quarto markdown files in the `ibis` repository. You
can adjust this code to work with any repository and any file type(s)! For
instance, we may also want to ingest all the `.py` files in the Ibis repsoitory.

### Embedding text to vectors

To search for similar text in traditional RAG fashion, we need to **embed** the
text into vectors. We can use [OpenAI's embedding
models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models) to
perform this step.

Note that the maximum length of input **tokens** is 8,191. A word typically
consists of 1-3 tokens. To estimate the number of tokens of a string in Python,
we can divide the length of that string by 4. This isn't perfect, but will work
for now. Let's augmented our data with the estimated number of tokens and sort
from largest to smallest:

```{python}
t = (
    t.mutate(tokens_estimate=t.contents.length() // 4)  # <1>
    .order_by(ibis._["tokens_estimate"].desc())  # <2>
    .relocate("filepath", "tokens_estimate")  # <3>
)
t
```

1. Augment the table with the estimated number of tokens.
2. Sort the table by the estimated number of tokens in descending order.
3. Relocate the `filepath` and `tokens_estimate` columns to the front of the table.

The longest text is certainly over our embedding model's token limit, and the
second longest might be as well. In practice, we'd want to chunk our text into
smaller pieces. This is its own challenge, but for the purposes of this
demonstration we'll just ignore text that is too long.

Let's define our embedding functions:

```{python}
def _embed(text: str) -> list[float]:  # <1>
    """Text to fixed-length array embedding."""  # <1>

    model = "text-embedding-3-small"  # <2>
    text = text.replace("\n", " ")  # <3>
    client = OpenAI()  # <4>

    try:  # <5>
        return (  # <6>
            client.embeddings.create(input=[text], model=model).data[0].embedding
        )  # <6>
    except Exception as e:  # <7>
        print(e)  # <7>
    return None  # <7>


@ibis.udf.scalar.python  # <8>
def embed(text: str, tokens_estimate: int) -> list[float]:  # <8>
    """Text to fixed-length array embedding."""  # <8>

    if 0 < tokens_estimate < 8191:  # <9>
        return _embed(text)  # <10>
    return None  # <11>
```

1. Define a regular Python function to embed text.
2. Define the embedding model to use.
3. Replace newlines with spaces.
4. Create an OpenAI client.
5. Since it's an external API call, we need to handle exceptions.
6. Call the OpenAI API to embed the text.
7. Handle exceptions and return `None` if an error occurs.
8. Define an Ibis UDF using the Python function.
9. If the estimated number of tokens is within the limit...
10. ...call the Python function to embed the text.
11. Otherwise, return `None`.

Let's embed the text:

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: false
_ = ibis.get_backend().raw_sql("set enable_progress_bar = false")
```

```{python}
t = t.mutate(  # <1>
    embedding=embed(t["contents"], t["tokens_estimate"])  # <1>
).cache()  # <1>
t
```

1. Augment the table with the embedded text and cache the result.

Notice there was one error -- that second row's content was indeed too long! Our
token estimate is a bit off, but overall useful. We accounted for this
possibility in our Python UDF above, returning `None` (mapped to `NULL` in
DuckDB) when the text is too long or an error occurs.

### Searching with cosine similarity

Cosine similarity over vectors is a common way to measure similarity for RAG
applications. We'll explore its downsides later. We need to make Ibis aware of
DuckDB's built-in `list_cosine_similarity` function:

```{python}
@ibis.udf.scalar.builtin  # <1>
def list_cosine_similarity(x, y) -> float:  # <1>
    """Compute cosine similarity between two vectors."""  # <1>
```

1. Use an Ibis builtin UDF to define a cosine similarity function.

::: {.callout-tip}
If using a different backend, you'll need to use its corresponding cosine
similarity function or define your own.
:::

Now we can search for similar text in the documentation:

```{python}
def search_docs(text):  # <1>
    embedding = _embed(text)  # <2>

    s = (
        t.mutate(similarity=list_cosine_similarity(t.embedding, embedding))  # <3>
        .relocate("similarity")  # <4>
        .order_by(ibis._["similarity"].desc())  # <5>
        .cache()  # <6>
    )

    return s
```

1. Define a function to search the documentation.
2. Embed the input text.
3. Augment the table with the cosine similarity between the embedded text and the input text.
4. Relocate the `similarity` column to the front of the table.
5. Sort the table by the cosine similarity in descending order.
6. Cache the result.

```{python}
text = "where can I chat with the community about Ibis?"
search_docs(text)
```

```{python}
text = "what do users say about Ibis?"
search_docs(text)
```

```{python}
text = "can Ibis complete the one billion row challenge?"
search_docs(text)
```

```{python}
text = "teach me about the Polars backend"
search_docs(text)
```

```{python}
text = "why does Voltron Data support Ibis?"
search_docs(text)
```

```{python}
text = "why should I use Ibis?"
search_docs(text)
```

```{python}
text = "what is the Ibis roadmap?"
search_docs(text)
```

## RAG pitfalls

As in traditional software engineering and machine learning, the architecture
when building systems around language models is not a universal. The best
depends on the application of the system. Using cosine (or otherwise) similarity
search over text transformed to numbers may not always perform best.

We can demonstrate this with the following scenario: let's assume we're building
a chatbot that writes and runs SQL on the user's behalf based on their questions
posed in English (or any language the language model understand sufficiently).
We might store past queries, the SQL generated, and some evaluation criteria
(upvote/downvote on the generated SQL from the user) in a database. Then we can
use the same RAG approach above to augment our queries with the user's past
queries and the generated SQL.

Take the following English query:

```{python}
a = """the first 10 rows of the penguins, ordered by body_mass_g from
lightest to heaviest"""
```

We can compute the cosine similarity of this query against itself, resulting in
1.0 or close to it:

```{python}
list_cosine_similarity(_embed(a), _embed(a))
```

Now, let's flip the ordering. This would result in an entirely different SQL
query and result set:

```{python}
b = """the first 10 rows of the penguins, ordered by body_mass_g from
heaviest to lightest"""
```

And compute the cosine similarity of `a` and `b`:

```{python}
list_cosine_similarity(_embed(a), _embed(b))
```

Similarly, we can construct a semantically equivalent query that would result in
the same SQL as example `a`:

```{python}
c = """of the birds retrieve the initial ten opposite-of-columns,
sorted from biggest to smallest by weight"""
```

That has a much lower cosine similarity in the embedding space:

```{python}
list_cosine_similarity(_embed(a), _embed(c))
```

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: false
if os.path.exists("rag.ddb"):
    os.remove("rag.ddb")
if os.path.exists("rag.ddb.wal"):
    os.remove("rag.ddb.wal")
```


Despite semantic equivalence, these two queries would not be considered similar.
You need to be careful and understand what the system is doing.

## Discussion

Is traditional RAG the best approach? It's unclear, and **it depends**.

### System architecture

Often RAG-based systems introduce yet-another-database to store the embeddings.
Hopefully this post has demonstrated that traditional database options can work
just fine. While we're only demonstrating this on a few rows here, DuckDB can
scale up to many millions with ease.

### Cost and speed

The cost of running this demo from OpenAI is less than $0.01 USD. It also runs
in about a minute, but with many rows this would be much slower. You need to
consider your architecture here. One option would be using an open source
embedding model that can run locally. Swap out the OpenAI calls with that and
see how it goes!

### Alternatives to vector search RAG

It's clear that we should always be augmenting our language model calls with the
most relevant context, even if traditional vector search RAG is not the best
solution.  The problem then becomes the best way to retrieve that context for a
given system's desired behavior.

::: {.callout-note title="Abolish RAG as terminology?"}
"I would like to abolish the term RAG and instead just agree that we should
always try to provide models with the appropriate context to provide high
quality answers." - [Hamel
Husain](https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1709740984643596768)
:::

Some alternatives to vector search RAG include:

- traditional search methods
- using an external web search engine
- using a language model for search

The last point is particularly interesting -- in the above examples with `a` and
`c` strings, cosine similarity in the embedding space could not tell the queries
are semantically equivalent. However, a sufficiently good language model
certainly could. As we demonstrated in [language models for
data](../lms-for-data/index.qmd), we could even setup a classifier and use [the
logit bias
trick](https://www.askmarvin.ai/docs/text/classification/#classifying-text) to
compute similarity with a single output token.

This trick makes the language model faster, but for practical applications the
cost and speed of language models for search is still a concern. We can expect
this concern to be mitigated over time as language models become faster and
cheaper to run.

With larger context lengths, we could also use an initial call to a language
model to extract out relevant sections of text and then make a second call with
that augmented context.

## Next steps

Try this out yourself! All you need is an OpenAI account and the code above.
