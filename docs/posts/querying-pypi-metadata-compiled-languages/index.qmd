Seth Larson wrote a great [blog
post](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-18)
on querying a PyPI dataset to look for trends in the use of memory-safe
languages in Python.

Check out Seth's article for more information on the dataset (and
it's a good read!). It caught our eye because it makes use of
[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) to clean the data for analysis.

That's right up our alley here in Ibis land, so let's see if we can duplicate
Seth's results (and then continue on to plot them!)

## Grab the data (locations)

Seth showed (and then safely decomposed) a nested `curl` statement and that's
always viable -- we're in Python land so why not grab the filenames using
`urllib3`?

```{python}
import urllib3

http = urllib3.PoolManager()

resp = http.request("GET", "https://github.com/pypi-data/data/raw/main/links/dataset.txt")

parquet_files = resp.data.decode().split()
parquet_files
```

## Grab the data

Now we're ready to get started with Ibis!

DuckDB is clever enough to grab only the parquet metadata.  This means we can
use `read_parquet` to create a lazy view of the parquet files and then build up
our expression without downloading everything beforehand!

```{python}
import ibis
from ibis import _  # <1>

ibis.options.interactive = True
```

1. See https://ibis-project.org/how-to/analytics/chain_expressions.html for docs
on the deferred operator!

Create a DuckDB connection:

```{python}
con = ibis.duckdb.connect()
```

And load up one of the files (we can run the full query after)!

```{python}
pypi = con.read_parquet(parquet_files[0], table_name="pypi")
```

```{python}
pypi.schema()
```

## Query crafting

Let's break down what we're looking for. As a high-level view of the use of
compiled languages, Seth is using file extensions as an indicator that a given
filetype is used in a Python project.

The dataset we're using has _every file in every project_ -- what criteria should we use?

We can follow Seth's lead and look for things:

1. A file extension that is one of: `asm`, `cc`, `cpp`, `cxx`, `h`, `hpp`, `rs`, `go`, and variants of `F90`, `f90`, etc...
   That is, C, C++, Assembly, Rust, Go, and Fortran.
2. We exclude matches where the file path is within the `site-packages/` directory.
3. We exclude matches that are in directories used for testing.

```{python}
expr = pypi.filter(
    [
        _.path.re_search(r"\.(asm|c|cc|cpp|cxx|h|hpp|rs|[Ff][0-9]{0-2}(?:or)?|go)$"),
        ~_.path.re_search(r"(^|/)test(|s|ing)"),
        ~_.path.contains("/site-packages/"),
    ]
)
expr
```

That _could_ be right -- we can peak at the filename at the end of the `path` column to do a quick check:

```{python}
expr.path.split("/")[-1]
```

Ok! Next up, we want to group the matches by:

1. The month that the package / file was published
   For this, we can use the `truncate` method and ask for month as our truncation window.
2. The file extension of the file used

```{python}
expr.group_by(
    month=_.uploaded_on.truncate("M"),
    ext=_.path.re_extract(r"\.([a-z0-9]+)$", 1),
).aggregate()
```

That looks promising. Now we need to grab the package names that correspond to a
given file extension in a given month and deduplicate it. And to match Seth's
results, we'll also sort by the month in descending order:

```{python}
expr = (
    expr.group_by(
        month=_.uploaded_on.truncate("M"),
        ext=_.path.re_extract(r"\.([a-z0-9]+)$", 1),
    )
    .aggregate(projects=_.project_name.collect().unique())
    .order_by(_.month.desc())
)

expr
```

## Massage and plot

Let's continue and see what our results look like.

We'll do a few things:

1. Combine all of the C and C++ extensions into a single group by renaming them all.
2. Count the number of distinct entries in each group
3. Plot the results!

```{python}
collapse_names = expr.mutate(
    ext=_.ext.re_replace(r"cxx|cpp|cc|c|hpp|h", "C/C++")
    .replace("rs", "Rust")
    .replace("go", "Go")
    .replace("asm", "Assembly"),
)

collapse_names
```

Note that now we need to de-duplicate again, since we might've had separate
unique entries for both an `h` and `c` file extension, and we don't want to
double-count!

We could rewrite our original query and include the renames in the original
`group_by` (this would be the smart thing to do), but let's push on and see if
we can make this work.

The `projects` column is now a column of string arrays, so we want to collect
all of the arrays in each group, this will give us a "list of lists", then we'll
`flatten` that list and call `unique().length()` as before.

DuckDB has a `flatten` function, but it isn't exposed in Ibis (yet!).

We'll use a handy bit of Ibis magic to define a `builtin` `UDF` that will map directly
onto the underlying DuckDB function (what!? See
[here](https://ibis-project.org/how-to/extending/builtin.html#duckdb) for more
info):

```{python}
@ibis.udf.scalar.builtin
def flatten(x: list[list[str]]) -> list[str]:
    ...


collapse_names = collapse_names.group_by(["month", "ext"]).aggregate(
    projects=flatten(_.projects.collect())
)

collapse_names
```

We could have included the `unique().length()` in the `aggregate` call, but
sometimes it's good to check that your slightly off-kilter idea has worked (and
it has!).

```{python}
collapse_names = collapse_names.select(
    _.month, _.ext, project_count=_.projects.unique().length()
)

collapse_names
```

Now that the data are tidied, we can pass our expression directly to Altair and see what it looks like!

```{python}
import altair as alt

chart = (
    alt.Chart(collapse_names)
    .mark_line()
    .encode(x="month", y="project_count", color="ext")
    .properties(width=600, height=300)
)
chart
```

That looks good, but it definitely doesn't match the plot from Seth's post:

![upstream plot](upstream_plot.png)

Our current plot is only showing the results from a subset of the available
data. Now that our expression is complete, we can re-run on the full dataset and
compare.

## The full run

To recap -- we pulled a lazy view of a single parquet file from the `pypi-data`
repo, filtered for all the files that contain file extensions we care about,
then grouped them all together to get counts of the various filetypes used
across projects by month.

Here's the entire query chained together into a single command, now running on
all of the `parquet` files we have access to:

```{python}
pypi = con.read_parquet(parquet_files, table_name="pypi")

full_query = (
    pypi.filter(
        [
            _.path.re_search(
                r"\.(asm|c|cc|cpp|cxx|h|hpp|rs|[Ff][0-9]{0-2}(?:or)?|go)$"
            ),
            ~_.path.re_search(r"(^|/)test(|s|ing)"),
            ~_.path.contains("/site-packages/"),
        ]
    )
    .group_by(
        month=_.uploaded_on.truncate("M"),
        ext=_.path.re_extract(r"\.([a-z0-9]+)$", 1),
    )
    .aggregate(projects=_.project_name.collect().unique())
    .order_by(_.month.desc())
    .mutate(
        ext=_.ext.re_replace(r"cxx|cpp|cc|c|hpp|h", "C/C++")
        .replace("rs", "Rust")
        .replace("go", "Go")
        .replace("asm", "Assembly"),
    )
    .group_by(["month", "ext"])
    .aggregate(project_count=flatten(_.projects.collect()).unique().length())
)
chart = (
    alt.Chart(full_query)
    .mark_line()
    .encode(x="month", y="project_count", color="ext")
    .properties(width=600, height=300)
)
chart
```
