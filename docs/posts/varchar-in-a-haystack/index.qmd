## The Scenario

You're a data analyst, and a new ticket just landed in your queue. It reads something like this:

> Subject: Urgent: Data Discovery Needed for Critical Analysis
> Hi Data Team,
> 
> I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out with an urgent request 
> that directly impacts the company's most critical project. We need to locate
> a specific value within our database but don't know which column it's in. 
> Unfortunately, we don't have documentation for this particular table. We are 
> looking for the value "NEEDLE" in the table.
> 
> We think it is in the X database, Y schema, and Z table. We appreciate your 
> help with this urgent matter!

You're not sure what to make of this request, but you're intrigued. You decide
to give it a shot.

## Next steps

It's pretty easy to do complex analysis with Ibis.
