# Overview

Have you ever needed to learn new dialects of database languages as a data
scientist or struggled with the differences between database languages? Does
your company manage different production pipelines with multiple databases
or engines? Have you needed to rewrite data pipelines from experimentation
to deployment?

These are challenges that SQLMesh and Ibis together can solve.

[SQLMesh](https://sqlmesh.com/) is a next-generation data transformation
and modeling framework. It aims to be easy to use, correct, and efficient
and is maintained by the [Tobiko Data](https://tobikodata.com/) team. It
helps you scalably, reliably and safely modify your data pipelines because
it understands SQL and can make intelligent updates instead of stringing
scripts together. SQLMesh boasts several future-proof features such as
automatic data contracts, virtual data environments and snapshots, extensive
change summaries (before updates are applied!) and column-level lineage out
of the box.

We walk through an example together to show you how to harness the full
potential of your data analytics workflow and how SQLMesh and Ibis can work
together hand-in-hand. Read the full article on
[SQLMesh blog](https://tobikodata.com/ibis-sqlmesh-unlocking-data-insights.html)!

In today's data-driven world, the ability to efficiently analyze and derive
insights from vast amounts of data is paramount. Leveraging powerful
open-source tools like SQLMesh and Ibis can streamline this process,
enabling you to easily manipulate and query data.
