# FILES

Your JupyterLite is structured like this:

    index.html             <---- you are here
    {:app}/                <---- currently-known: `lab` (semi-required) and `notebook`
      index.html
      extensions/
        {:org}/{:package}/ <---|
        {:package}/        <---+- federated extensions
          schema/
          package.json
    # TBD
    files/                 <----- also need to populate `api/contents/`!
    static/                <----- might save duplication
      {:app}

-->
<html>
  <head>
    <!--
      # jupyter-config-data

      The JSON in `jupyter-lite.json` is the last that will be loaded by most
      child `index.html` pages, and every field can be overridden.

      See the recognized schema as described in the documentation:

      - https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/schema

      Notes
        - fields that...
          - are relative paths values
            - will have the parent directory of _this_ file appended, accounting
              for "magic" hosts which redirect to `{:path}index.html` to `{:path}`,
              with or without a slash
        - some fields, such as `federated_extensions` will be _added together_

    <!--
      # jupyter-lite-root

      The source of truth for relative path locations. The `.` means _this_
      is the root, and will redirect to the `appUrl` defined in
      `.jupyter-lite/#jupyter-config-data`.
