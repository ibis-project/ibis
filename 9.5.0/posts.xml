<p><strong><em>Ibis + ClickHouse + Shiny for Python = better PyPI stats.</em></strong></p>
<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://pypistats.org/about">PyPI Stats</a> is a great resource for Python package download statistics from PyPI. However, it only contains 180 days of data and lacks more detailed analysis we might be interested in. In this post, we’ll build a dynamic Python application for better PyPI stats using <a href="https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse">ClickHouse</a> as our data platform, <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis">Ibis</a> as our Python data interface, and <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/py-shiny">Shiny for Python</a> as our dashboarding tool.</p>

What about ClickPy?

</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p><a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickpy">ClickPy</a> is an existing open source and reproducible project built on the same data with ClickHouse. The primary difference is that ClickPy uses SQL and JavaScript whereas this project is in Python. We also focus on different visualizations and metrics.</p>

  <title>Farewell pandas, and thanks for all the fish.</title>
  <dc:creator>Gil Forsyth</dc:creator>
  <link>https://ibis-project.org/posts/farewell-pandas/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p><strong>TL; DR</strong>: we are deprecating the <code>pandas</code> and <code>dask</code> backends and will be removing them in version 10.0.</p>
<p>There is no feature gap between the <code>pandas</code> backend and our default DuckDB backend, and DuckDB is <em>much</em> more performant. <code>pandas</code> DataFrames will still be available as <em>format</em> for getting data to and from Ibis, we just won’t support using <code>pandas</code> to execute queries.</p>
<p>Most of the rationale below applies to the Dask backend since it has so much in common with pandas. Dask is a great project and people should continue to use it outside the Ibis context.</p>
<section id="why-pandas-and-a-bit-of-ibis-history" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-pandas-and-a-bit-of-ibis-history">Why <code>pandas</code>? And a bit of Ibis history</h2>
<p>Way back in the early days of Ibis, there was only one backend: Impala. Not everyone used Impala (mindblowing, we know), and so it wasn’t too long until the Postgres backend was added (by the inimitable Phillip Cloud).</p>
<p>These two backends were both featureful, but there was a big problem with adoption: Want to try out Ibis? You need to install Impala or Postgres first.</p>
<p>Not an insurmountable problem, but a LOT more work than “just <code>pip install &lt;newthing&gt;</code>” – which prompted the question, how can a prospective Ibis user take the API for a spin without requiring a DBA or extra infrastructure beyond a laptop?</p>
<p>The obvious answer (at the time) was to use the only in-memory DataFrame engine around and wire up a <code>pandas</code> backend.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-agony-and-the-agony" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-agony-and-the-agony">The agony and the agony</h2>
<p><code>pandas</code> was the best option at the time, and it allowed new users to try out Ibis. But, it never fit well into the model of data analysis that Ibis strives for. The <code>pandas</code> backend has more specialized code than any other backend, because it is so fundamentally different than all the other systems Ibis works with.</p>
<section id="deferred-vs-eager" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deferred-vs-eager">Deferred vs Eager</h3>
<p><code>pandas</code> is inherently an eager engine – every time you hit Enter you are computing an intermediate result. Ibis uses a deferred execution model, similar to what nearly all SQL backends use, that enables query planning and optimization passes.</p>
<p>Trying to make a <code>pandas</code> interface that behaves in a deferred way is hard.</p>
<p>One of the unfortunate effects of this mismatch is that, unlike our other backends, the <code>pandas</code> backend is often <em>much</em> slower than just using <code>pandas</code> directly.</p>
<p>And to provide this suboptimal experience, we have a few thousand lines of code that are only used in the <code>pandas</code> backend.</p>
</section>
<section id="nan-vs-null" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="nan-vs-null"><code>NaN</code> vs <code>NULL</code></h3>
<p>The choice was made a long time ago to accept using <code>NaN</code> as the marker for missing values in <code>pandas</code>. This is because NumPy has a notion of <code>NaN</code>, but a Python <code>None</code> would lead to an <code>object</code>-dtype and poor performance.</p>
<p>Practicality beats purity, but this is a horrible decision to have to make. Ibis <em>doesn’t</em> have to make it with any other backend, because NULL indicates a missing value, and NaN is Not a Number.</p>
<p>Those are fundamentally different ideas and it is an ongoing headache for Ibis to try to pretend that they aren’t.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-types" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-types">Data types</h3>
<p>The new Arrow-backed types in <code>pandas</code> are a great improvement and we’ll leave it at that.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="misleading-new-users" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="misleading-new-users">Misleading new users</h2>
<p>People reach for what is familiar. When you try Ibis for the first time, we’re asking you to both a) try Ibis and b) pick a backend. We have defaults to try to help with this, but it can be confusing at first.</p>
<p>We have many reports from new users that “Ibis is slow”. What this almost always means is that they tried the <code>pandas</code> backend (because they know <code>pandas</code>) and they are having a less-than-great time.</p>
<p>If they tried DuckDB or Polars, instead, they would have a much easier time getting things going.</p>
</section>
<section id="feature-parity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-parity">Feature parity</h2>
<p>This is the one of the strongest reasons to drop the <code>pandas</code> backend – it is redundant. The DuckDB backend can seamlessly query pandas DataFrames, supports several flavors of UDF, and can read and write parquet, CSV, JSON, and other formats.</p>
<p>There is a reason DuckDB is our default backend: it’s easy to install, it runs locally, it’s blazing fast, and it interacts well with the Python ecosystem. Those are all the reasons we added <code>pandas</code> as a backend in the first place, but with the added benefit of blazing-fast results, and no type-system headaches.</p>

<p>The <code>train_base.parquet</code> file is the base table, while the others are feature tables. Let’s take a quick look at these tables.</p>
<section id="base-table" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="base-table">Base table</h4>
<p>The base table (<code>train_base.parquet</code>) contains the unique ID, a binary target flag and other information for the training samples. This unique ID will serve as the linking key for joining with other feature tables.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>case_id</code> - This is the unique ID for each loan. You’ll need this ID to join feature tables to the base table. There are about 1.5m unique loans.</li>
<li><code>date_decision</code> - This refers to the date when a decision was made regarding the approval of the loan.</li>
<li><code>WEEK_NUM</code> - This is the week number used for aggregation. In the test sample, <code>WEEK_NUM</code> continues sequentially from the last training value of <code>WEEK_NUM</code>.</li>
<li><code>MONTH</code> - This column represents the month when the approval decision was made.</li>
<li><code>target</code> - This is the binary target flag, determined after a certain period based on whether or not the client defaulted on the specific loan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is several examples from the base table:</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feature-tables">Feature tables</h4>
<p>The remaining files contain features, consisting of approximately 370 features from previous loan applications and external data sources. Their definitions can be found in the feature definition <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-credit-risk-model-stability/data">file</a> from the competition website.</p>
<p>There are several things we want to mention for the feature tables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Union datasets</strong>: One dataset could be saved into multiple parquet files, such as <code>train_applprev_1_0.parquet</code> and <code>train_applprev_1_1.parquet</code>, We need to union this data.</li>
<li><strong>Dataset levels</strong>: Datasets may have different levels, which we will explain as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Depth = 0</strong>: Each row in the table is identified by a unique <code>case_id</code>. In this case, you can directly join the features with the base table and use them as features for further analysis or processing.</li>
<li><strong>Depth &gt; 0</strong>: You will group the data based on the <code>case_id</code> and perform calculations or aggregations within each group.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are two examples of tables with different levels.</p>
<p>Example of table with depth = 0, <code>case_id</code> is the row identifier, features can be directly joined with the base table.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-loading-and-processing-1">Data loading and processing</h3>
<p>We will perform the following data processing steps using Ibis and IbisML:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convert data types</strong>: Ensure consistency by converting data types, as the same column in different sub-files may have different types.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregate features</strong>: For tables with depth greater than 0, aggregate features based on <code>case_id</code>, including statistics calculation. You can collect statistics such as mean, median, mode, minimum, standard deviation, and others.</li>
<li><strong>Union and join datasets</strong>: Combine multiple sub-files of the same dataset into one table, as some datasets are split into multiple sub-files with a common prefix. Afterward, join these tables with the base table.</li>
</ul>
<section id="convert-data-types" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="convert-data-types">Convert data types</h4>
<p>We’ll use IbisML to create a chain of <code>Cast</code> steps, forming a recipe for data type conversion across the dataset. This conversion is based on the provided information extracted from column names. Columns that have similar transformations are indicated by a capital letter at the end of their names:</p>
<ul>
<li>P - Transform DPD (Days past due)</li>
<li>M - Masking categories</li>
<li>A - Transform amount</li>
<li>D - Transform date</li>
<li>T - Unspecified Transform</li>
<li>L - Unspecified Transform</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we’ll define a IbisML transformation step to convert columns ends with <code>P</code> to floating number:</p>
<div id="92f70762" class="cell" data-execution_count="8">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb13" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb13-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"># convert columns ends with P to floating number</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">step_cast_P_to_float <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> ml.Cast(ml.endswith(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"P"</span>), dt.float64)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next, let’s define additional type conversion transformations based on the postfix of column names:</p>
<div id="3e3be631" class="cell" data-execution_count="9">
<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Show code to define more steps</summary>

<p>After completing data preprocessing with Ibis and IbisML, we proceed to the modeling phase. Here are two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use IbisML as a independent data preprocessing component and hand off the data to downstream modeling frameworks with various output formats:
<ul>
<li>pandas Dataframe</li>
<li>NumPy Array</li>
<li>Polars Dataframe</li>
<li>Dask Dataframe</li>
<li>xgboost.DMatrix</li>
<li>Pyarrow Table</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use IbisML recipes as components within an sklearn Pipeline and train models similarly to how you would do with sklearn pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will build an XGBoost model within a scikit-learn pipeline, and a neural network classifier using the output transformed by IbisML recipes.</p>

<p>We’ll use hashing on the unique key to consistently split rows to different groups. Hashing is robust to underlying changes in the data, such as adding, deleting, or reordering rows. This deterministic process ensures that each data point is always assigned to the same split, thereby enhancing reproducibility.</p>

<p>Hashing provides a consistent but pseudo-random distribution of data, which may not precisely align with the specified train/test ratio. While hash codes ensure reproducibility, they don’t guarantee an exact split. Due to statistical variance, you might find a slight imbalance in the distribution, resulting in marginally more or fewer samples in either the training or test dataset than the target percentage. This minor deviation from the intended ratio is a normal consequence of hash-based partitioning.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>IbisML provides a powerful suite of last-mile preprocessing transformations, including an advanced column selector that streamlines the selection and transformation of specific columns in your dataset.</p>
<p>It integrates seamlessly with scikit-learn pipelines, allowing you to incorporate preprocessing recipes directly into your workflow. Additionally, IbisML supports a variety of data output formats such as Dask, NumPy, and Arrow, ensuring compatibility with different machine learning frameworks.</p>
<p>Another key advantage of IbisML is its flexibility in performing data preprocessing across multiple backends, including DuckDB, Polars, Spark, BigQuery, and other Ibis backends. This enables you to preprocess your training data using the backend that best suits your needs, whether for large or small datasets, on local machines or compute backends, and in both development and production environments. Stay tuned for a future post where we will explore this capability in more detail.</p>

<p><strong><em>TPC-H benchmark at <code>sf=1024</code> via DuckDB, DataFusion, and Polars on a MacBook Pro with 96GiB of RAM.</em></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>pandas requires your dataframe to fit in memory. Out-of-memory (OOM) errors are common when working on larger datasets, though the corresponding size of data on disk can be surprising. The creator of pandas and Ibis noted in <a href="https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals">“Apache Arrow and the ‘10 Things I Hate About pandas’”</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To put it simply, <strong>we weren’t thinking about analyzing 100 GB or 1 TB datasets in 2011</strong>. [In 2017], my rule of thumb for pandas is that <strong>you should have 5 to 10 times as much RAM as the size of your dataset</strong>. So if you have a 10 GB dataset, you should really have about 64, preferably 128 GB of RAM if you want to avoid memory management problems. This comes as a shock to users who expect to be able to analyze datasets that are within a factor of 2 or 3 the size of their computer’s RAM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today with Ibis you can reliably and efficiently process a 1TB dataset on a laptop with &lt;1/10th the RAM.</p>

<p>This represents <strong>a 50-100X improvement</strong> in RAM requirements for Python dataframes in just 7 years thanks to <a href="https://wesmckinney.com/blog/looking-back-15-years">composable data systems</a> and <a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/06/26/benchmarks-over-time">hard work by the DuckDB team</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve generated ~1TB (<code>sf=1024</code>) of <a href="https://www.tpc.org/tpch">TPC-H data</a> on my MacBook Pro with 96 GiB of RAM. We’ll start exploring it with pandas, Polars, and Ibis and discuss where and why they start to struggle.</p>

<p>See <a href="../../posts/ibis-bench/index.html#reproducing-the-benchmark">the previous post</a> for instructions on generating the data. I used <code>bench gen-data -s 1024 -n 128</code>, partitioning the data to avoid OOM errors while it generated.</p>
<p>I’d recommend instead generating a smaller scale factor and copying it as many times as needed, as generating the data at <code>sf=1024</code> can take a long time.</p>

<p>Ibis, with the default backend of DuckDB, can display the first few rows. Polars (lazy) can too in regular and streaming mode. For lazily computation, an underlying query engine has the opportunity to determine a subset of data to be read into memory that satisfies a given query. For example, to display any three rows from the <code>lineitem</code> table it can just read the first three rows from the first Parquet file in the dataset.</p>
<p>Both pandas and Polars (eager) crash Python as they must load all the data into memory to construct their dataframes. This is expected because the table in memory ~6X larger than our 96GiB of RAM.</p>

This forces at least some columns from all rows of data to pass through the query engine to determine the top 3 rows per the specified ordering. Since the data is larger than RAM, only “streaming” engines can handle this. We’ll try with the methods that worked on the previous query and add in the DataFusion backend for Ibis.</p>

<p>Ibis with the DuckDB and DataFusion backends complete this in about 2 minutes each. Polars (lazy) crashes the kernel after about 2 minutes with its default mode and panics in streaming mode.</p>
<p><strong>Streaming is an overloaded term here</strong>. In the context of Ibis, a streaming backend refers to a near real-time data processing engine like <a href="https://ibis-project.org/backends/flink">Apache Flink</a> or <a href="https://ibis-project.org/backends/risingwave">RisingWave</a>. In the context of Polars, streaming is a separate engine from the default that can handle larger-than-memory data. This general paradigm is already used by DuckDB and DataFusion, hence their ability to complete the above query. <a href="https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/16694#issuecomment-2146668559">The Polars team does not recommend using their current streaming engine for benchmarking</a> and has <a href="https://pola.rs/posts/announcing-polars-1/#new-engine-design">announced a new version of their streaming engine</a>.</p>
<p>As we’ll see in the benchmark result, some queries will fail to complete with Polars and DataFusion. These queries are killed by the operating system due to a lack of memory.</p>

<p>If we want to work with pandas or Polars dataframes at larger scales, we can use Ibis to sample or filter the data (and perform any other operations) with computation pushed to a more scalable backend. Then just output the Ibis dataframe to pandas or Polars for downstream use:</p>

<p>See <a href="../../posts/ibis-bench/index.html">the prior benchmark post</a> for more details and key considerations. Key differences in this iteration include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>polars-u64-idx</code> was used instead of <code>polars</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount/ibis-bench/pull/5">Some Polars queries were updated</a></li>
<li>Parquet files were generated with <code>n=128</code> partitions
<ul>
<li>this was done to avoid OOM errors when generating the data</li>
<li>this should have little impact on the query execution time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Queries 18 and 21 for Polars, 9 and 18 for DataFusion were skipped
<ul>
<li>they ran for a very long time without completing or failing</li>
<li>the prior benchmark indicates these queries would likely eventually fail</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The Python package versions used were:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ibis-framework==9.1.0</code></li>
<li><code>datafusion==38.0.1</code></li>
<li><code>duckdb==1.0.0</code></li>
<li><code>polars-u64-idx==1.0.0</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The three systems tested were:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ibis-duckdb</code>: Ibis dataframe code on the DuckDB backend</li>
<li><code>ibis-datafusion</code>: Ibis dataframe code on the DataFusion backend</li>
<li><code>polars-lazy</code>: Polars (lazy API) dataframe code</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ibis-duckdb</code> completed all 22/22 queries <strong>in under 30 minutes</strong>. If you need to run batch data jobs on a similar amount of data, a laptop might be all you need!</p>
<p><code>ibis-datafusion</code> only completed 17/22 queries, though recall <a href="../../posts/ibis-bench/index.html#failing-datafusion-queries">3 are failing due to a bug that’s already been fixed</a>. A new Python release for DataFusion hasn’t been made yet, so we ran with the old version. Assuming those queries would complete, only 2 queries would be failing due to lack of memory. More investigation would be needed to determine the work needed for all 22 queries to pass under these conditions.</p>
<p><code>polars-lazy</code> only completed 13/22 queries, with 8 failing due lack of memory. The <a href="https://pola.rs/posts/announcing-polars-1/#new-engine-design">new streaming engine</a> will likely help with this.</p>
<p>Let’s plot execution time for each query and system:</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>It might be easier to look at 2 systems at a time. You can click on a system in the legend of the plot to de-select it.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h2>
<p>The ability to run all 1TB TPC-H queries on a relatively standard laptop with minimal setup represents a significant shift in the Python data ecosystem that benefits individual data practitioners and organizations.</p>
<section id="scale-up-then-scale-out" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scale-up-then-scale-out">Scale up, then scale out</h3>
<p>Distributed systems are hard and introduce complexity for data workloads. While distributed OLAP query engines have their place, the threshold for considering them against a single-node OLAP query engine has been raised drastically over the last few years. You can <a href="https://duckdb.org/2024/06/26/benchmarks-over-time">see how much DuckDB has improved over the years</a> and it shows in this benchmark.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to start with a single node and see how far you can get. You’ll need to consider the tradeoffs for your own situation to make a decision. With Ibis, you can write your queries once and try them on different engines to see which is best for your workload.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="composable-data-systems-are-here">Composable data systems are here</h3>
<p>Ibis separates the query from the engine. It translates dataframe code into an intermediate representation (IR) in the backend’s native language – often SQL, sometimes other Python dataframe code. This separation allows you <strong>to use a single dataframe API for the best engine(s) across your workload(s)</strong>.</p>
<p>If you need to analyze data in <a href="https://ibis-project.org/backends/postgres">Postgres</a>, you can use Ibis. If you need to <a href="https://duckdb.org/2022/09/30/postgres-scanner.html">speed that up with DuckDB</a>, you can <a href="https://ibis-project.org/backends/duckdb#ibis.backends.duckdb.Backend.read_postgres">use Ibis</a>. If you need to scale out with <a href="https://ibis-project.org/backends/dask">Dask</a> or <a href="https://ibis-project.org/backends/pyspark">PySpark</a> or <a href="https://ibis-project.org/backends/trino">Trino</a>, you can use Ibis. If you need to <a href="../../posts/why-voda-supports-ibis/index.html">scale out on distributed GPUs you can use Ibis</a>. If another query engine comes along and is best for your workload, you can probably use Ibis. New backends are fairly easy to add!</p>

<p>For ~$1,600/month we can get a machine with more CPU cores and RAM than the laptop benchmarked in this post. This cost assumes you’re running the machine 24/7 – if you only needed to run a workload similar to the benchmark here, you’d only need to run the machine &lt;1 hour per day using Ibis with the default DuckDB backend. This can serve as a good anchor when evaluating your cost of compute for data.</p>
<p>A composable data system with Python dataframe and SQL user experiences can scale vertically to handle workloads into 10TB+ range with modern single-node OLAP query engines. If you need a distributed query engine or a better single-node query engine for your workload materializes, you can swap them out without changing your queries. However, note that with vertical scaling you’re likely to hit storage or network bottlenecks before compute bottlenecks on real workloads.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-considerations">Key considerations</h2>
<p>The purpose of this post is to explore some benchmarking data with Ibis. We’ll compare three modern single-node query engines, explore the Ibis API as a great choice for each of them, and discuss the results.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="https://www.tpc.org/tpch">The TPC-H benchmark</a> is a benchmark for databases and, <a href="https://docs.coiled.io/blog/tpch">increasingly</a>, <a href="https://pola.rs/posts/benchmarks">dataframes</a>! It consists of 22 queries across 8 tables. The SQL (or dataframe) code representing the queries is designed to test the performance of a query engine on a variety of tasks including filtering, aggregation, and joins. SQL queries are defined by the TPC-H benchmark. We run the SQL queries and equivalent dataframe code via Ibis and Polars APIs.</p>
<p>The data for the benchmark can be generated at any scale factor, which roughly corresponds to the size of the data in memory in gigabytes. For instance, a scale factor of 10 would be about 10GB of data in memory.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-engines-the-api-the-code">The engines, the API, the code</h3>
<p>We’ll use three modern single-node OLAP engines (<a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb">DuckDB</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion">DataFusion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pola-rs/polars">Polars</a>) with the Ibis API via two coding paradigms (dataframe and SQL). Ibis provides a consistent API across 20+ backends, including these three. We run <a href="https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount/ibis-bench/blob/v2.0.0/src/ibis_bench/queries/sql.py">SQL code</a> through Ibis in addition to <a href="https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount/ibis-bench/blob/v2.0.0/src/ibis_bench/queries/ibis.py">dataframe code</a> to get a sense of any overhead in Ibis dataframe code.</p>

<p>9/22 queries for Ibis with the Polars backend fail from lack of scalar subquery support. Due to this and relatively experimental SQL support in Polars, we’ve opted to run on <a href="https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount/ibis-bench/blob/v2.0.0/src/ibis_bench/queries/polars.py">the Polars API directly</a> in this iteration of the benchmark. This is done with the LazyFrames API <strong>and no streaming engine</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/16694#issuecomment-2146668559">per the Polars team’s recommendation</a>). This also allows us to compare the performance of the Polars backend through Ibis with the Polars API directly for the queries that do succeed.</p>
<section id="failing-queries" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="failing-queries">Failing queries</h4>
<p>Queries fail for one of two reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The query doesn’t work in the given system</li>
<li>The query otherwise failed on a given run</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll note the cases of the first below. The second is usually due to memory pressure and will be seen at higher scale factors throughout the data.</p>
</section>
<section id="failing-datafusion-queries" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="failing-datafusion-queries">Failing DataFusion queries</h4>
<p>Queries 16, 21, and 22 fail for the DataFusion backend via Ibis dataframe code, and query 16 fails through SQL. Note that <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion-benchmarks">all TPC-H SQL queries successfully run through DataFusion directly</a> – Ibis generates SQL that <a href="https://github.com/apache/datafusion/issues/10830">hits a bug with DataFusion that has already been fixed</a>. We expect these queries to work in the next iteration of this benchmark coming soon.</p>
</section>
<section id="failing-polars-queries" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="failing-polars-queries">Failing Polars queries</h4>
<p>Queries 11, 13-17, and 20-22 fail for the Polars backend via Ibis dataframe code. These all fail due to lack of scalar subquery support in the backend. I’ve <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/9422">opened an issue</a> for tracking and discussion.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/lostmygithubaccount/ibis-bench/tree/v2.0.0/src/ibis_bench/queries">the source code</a> for the exact queries used in this iteration of the benchmark. Polars recently updated their TPC-H queries, so the next iteration of this benchmark would use those.</p>
<p>Queries were adapted from <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/tree/main/ibis/backends/tests/tpch">Ibis TPC-H queries</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pola-rs/tpch">Polars TPC-H queries</a>. The first 10 Ibis dataframe queries were translated from the Polars dataframe queries, while the rest were directly adapted from the Ibis repository. The SQL strings were adapted from the Ibis repository.</p>

<ul>
<li>data is generated as a Parquet file per table

<li>standard DuckDB Parquet writer is used</li>
<li>data is always downloaded onto a compute instance (no cloud storage reads)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>decimal types are converted to floats after reading
<ul>
<li>works around several issues</li>
<li>in the next iteration of this benchmark, we’ll use the <code>decimal</code> type</li>
</ul></li>
<li>each query is run three times per configuration (system, scale factor, instance type)</li>
<li>we measure the time to write the results of the query to a Parquet file
<ul>
<li>this includes reading the Parquet file(s) and executing the query</li>

<p>A scale factor is roughly the size of the data in memory in gigabytes. For example, a scale factor of 1 means the data is roughly 1GB in memory.</p>
<p>Stored on disk in (compressed) Parquet format, the data is smaller – about 0.38GB for scale factor 1 with the compression settings used in this benchmark.</p>

<p>An instance type is the compute the benchmark was run on. This consists of two MacBook Pro laptops (one work and one personal) and a number of Google Cloud Compute Engine instances.</p>
<p>For cloud VMs, the instance type is in the form of <code>&lt;family&gt;-&lt;type&gt;-&lt;cores&gt;</code>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;family&gt;</code> specifies the CPU architecture (Intel X, AMD Y)</li>
<li><code>&lt;type&gt;</code> modifies the CPU to memory ratio (only <code>standard</code> is used with a 1:4)</li>
<li><code>&lt;cores&gt;</code> is the number of vCPUs</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, <code>n2d-standard-2</code> is a Google Cloud Compute Engine instance with an AMD EPYC processor, 2 vCPUs, and 8GB of memory.</p>

<p>We can look at the total execution time by instance type:</p>

<p><code>ibis-duckdb</code> is running the TPC-H queries written as Ibis dataframe code. The <code>ibis-duckdb-sql</code> system is running the same queries but written as SQL code passed into <code>.sql()</code> in Ibis as strings. The intent is to see if Ibis dataframe code is introducing any significant overhead. While ideally we’d run on the backend’s Python client without Ibis in the mix, this keeps the benchmarking process simple and should serve as a decent proxy.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this case, we do see that Ibis dataframe code is adding some overhead. But, this is a single data point – let’s expand to the first 7 queries:</p>

<p>From here, we’ll set <code>log_y=True</code> due to the wide range of execution times.</p>
<p>We also look at the first 7 queries due to limited horizontal space on this website. Analyze and visualize the data yourself for all 22 queries! Or <a href="https://ibis-bench.streamlit.app">see the Ibis benchmarking Streamlit app</a>.</p>

<p>Ibis dataframe code is a little faster overall, but this is on a subset of queries and scale factors and instance types. More analysis and profiling would be needed to make a definitive statement, but in general we can be happy that DuckDB does a great job optimizing the SQL Ibis generates and that Ibis dataframe code isn’t adding significant overhead.</p>
<p>Let’s repeat this for DataFusion:</p>

<p>This time Ibis dataframe code is a bit slower overall. <strong>However, also notice two queries are missing from <code>ibis-datafusion-sql</code></strong>. These are query 7 on <code>n2d-standard-2</code> and <code>n2d-standard-4</code> (the two instances with the least memory). We’ll investigate failing queries more thoroughly in the next section.</p>

<p>There is a lot of data and it’s easy to summarize and visualize it in a way that favors a given system. There’s a lot of missing data that needs to be accounted for, as it often indicates a query that failed due to memory pressure.</p>
<p>Each system has strengths and weaknesses. See the discussion section below.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://ibis-bench.streamlit.app">Ibis benchmarking Streamlit app</a> for further analysis, or query the data yourself!</p>

<p>Many queries fail due to memory pressure at higher scale factors with insufficient resources. Impressively, the exception here is DuckDB.</p>

<section id="which-system-is-best" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-system-is-best">Which system is best?</h3>
<p>Trick question! It depends on your use case. DuckDB is a simple, performant in-process database with an on-disk file format (SQLite for OLAP). DataFusion is an extensible query engine and is often used for building databases or query engines. Polars is an OLAP query engine with a Python dataframe API that can be used as a more performant alternative to pandas.</p>
<p>All three make great Ibis backends and you can switch between them in a single line of code. This lets you write your code once and run it on the engine that’s best for your use case. If a better engine comes along you’ll likely be able to use that too. And you can scale up and out across the 20+ backends Ibis supports as needed.</p>
<p>TPC-H is a decent benchmark <em>for what it benchmarks, which is limited</em>. We’re not running window functions, doing timeseries analysis, or feature engineering for machine learning. We’re not using nested data types. We’re not performing regexes or using LLMs in UDFs…</p>
<p>It’s easy to summarize and visualize benchmarking data in a way that favors a given system. You should favor the system that works best for your use case.</p>

<section id="performance-converges-over-time" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performance-converges-over-time">Performance converges over time</h3>
<p>Let’s look at some quotes from <a href="https://motherduck.com/blog/perf-is-not-enough">“Perf is not enough”</a> by Jordan Tigani of MotherDuck:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If you take a bunch of databases, all actively maintained, and iterate them out a few years, <strong>performance is going to converge</strong>. If Clickhouse is applying a technique that gives it an advantage for scan speed today, Snowflake will likely have that within a year or two. If Snowflake adds incrementally materialized views, BigQuery will soon follow. It is unlikely that important performance differences will persist over time.</p>
<p>As clever as the engineers working for any of these companies are, none of them possess any magic incantations or things that cannot be replicated elsewhere. Each database uses a different bag of tricks in order to get good performance. One might compile queries to machine code, another might cache data on local SSDs, and a third might use specialized network hardware to do shuffles. <strong>Given time, all of these techniques can be implemented by anyone. If they work well, they likely will show up everywhere.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is extra true for open source databases (or query engines). If DuckDB adds a feature that improves performance, it’s likely that DataFusion and Polars will follow suit – they can go read the source code and specific commits to see how it was done.</p>

<p>The scale factor is roughly the size of data <strong>in memory</strong> in gigabytes (GBs). The size of data on disk, however, is smaller because Parquet is compressed. We can take a look at the size of the data:</p>

<p>We can see the total size is 0.38 GB and the size of the tables – <code>lineitem</code> is by far the largest.</p>
<p>Using <code>bench run</code> results in a <code>results_data</code> directory with the results of the queries and a <code>bench_logs_v2</code> directory with the logs of the benchmark run.</p>

  <title>Ibis - Now flying on Snowflake</title>
  <dc:creator>Phillip Cloud</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Ibis allows you to push down compute operations on your data where it lives, with the performance being as powerful as the backend you’re connected to. But what happens if Ibis is running <em>inside</em> the backend you’re connected to?</p>
<p>In this post, we will discuss how we got Ibis running on a Snowflake virtual warehouse.</p>
<section id="why-would-we-want-to-do-this" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-would-we-want-to-do-this">Why would we want to do&nbsp;this?</h2>
<p>Snowflake has released several features to enable users to execute native Python code on the platform. These features include a new notebook development interface, Streamlit in Snowflake, the Native App framework, and Python within functions and stored procedures.</p>
<p>If users could use Ibis directly within the platform, developers could more easily switch between a local execution engine during development and efficiently deploy and operationalize that same code on Snowflake.</p>
<p>But this isn’t without its challenges; there were a few things we needed to figure out, and these are the questions we will answer throughout the post.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can we get an Ibis connection to Snowflake - from within Snowflake?</li>
<li>How can we use third-party packages in Snowflake?</li>
<li>How are we going to test this to ensure it works?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="getting-the-ibis-connection" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-the-ibis-connection">Getting the Ibis connection</h2>
<p>The release of Ibis 9.2 includes the introduction of a new method, <a href="../../backends/snowflake.html#ibis.backends.snowflake.Backend.from_connection"><code>from_connection</code></a> to provide users with a convenient mechanism to take an existing Snowpark session and create an Ibis Snowflake backend instance with it.</p>
<p>Here’s what this looks like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">import</span> ibis</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">import</span> snowflake.snowpark <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">as</span> sp</span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4">session <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> sp.Session.builder.create()</span>
<span id="cb1-5">con <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> ibis.snowflake.from_connection(session)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This connection uses the same session within Snowflake, so temporary objects can be accessed using Snowpark or Ibis in the same process!&nbsp;The contexts of stored procedures already have a session available, meaning we can use this new method and start writing Ibis expressions.</p>
<p>The way this works is that Ibis plucks out an attribute on the Snowpark session, which gives us the <a href="https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python"><code>snowflake-connector-python</code></a> <a href="https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/blob/42fa6ebe9404e0e17afdacfcaceb311dda5cde3e/src/snowflake/connector/connection.py#L313"><code>SnowflakeConnection</code></a> instance used by Snowpark.</p>
<p>Since Ibis uses <code>snowflake-connector-python</code> for all Snowflake-related connection we just reuse that existing instance.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="uploading-third-party-packages">Uploading third-party packages</h2>
<p>Snowflake has many packages already made available out of the box through the Snowflake Anaconda channel, but unfortunately, Ibis and a few of its dependencies aren’t available.&nbsp;Packages containing pure Python code can be uploaded to stages for use within the platform, so we devised a clever solution to upload and reference these to get them working.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="more-permanent-solutions-to-packaging">More permanent solutions to packaging</h2>
<p>It’s possible that a more permanent solution could be achieved with a <code>put</code> or <code>put_stream</code> method rather than using the <code>add_import</code> method. This would allow for the packages to be referenced across multiple stored procedures or other places within the Snowflake platform.</p>
</section>
<section id="testing" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="testing">Testing!</h2>
<p>While this is a clever solution, we must ensure it works consistently. A special unit test has been written for this exact case! The test creates a stored procedure by adding the necessary imports to the Snowpark session. Within the stored procedure, we define an Ibis expression, and we use the Ibis <code>to_sql</code> method to extract the generated SQL to pass to Snowpark to return a Snowpark DataFrame!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While it’s usually pretty easy to add new backends with Ibis, this was the first instance of supporting an additional interface to an existing backend.</p>
<p>We hope you take this for a spin! If you run into any challenges or want additional support, open an <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues">issue</a> or join us on <a href="https://ibis-project.zulipchat.com/">Zulip</a> and let us know!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="overview" class="level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Have you ever needed to learn new dialects of database languages as a data scientist or struggled with the differences between database languages? Does your company manage different production pipelines with multiple databases or engines? Have you needed to rewrite data pipelines from experimentation to deployment?</p>
<p>These are challenges that SQLMesh and Ibis together can solve.</p>
<p><a href="https://sqlmesh.com/">SQLMesh</a> is a next-generation data transformation and modeling framework. It aims to be easy to use, correct, and efficient and is maintained by the <a href="https://tobikodata.com/">Tobiko Data</a> team. It helps you scalably, reliably and safely modify your data pipelines because it understands SQL and can make intelligent updates instead of stringing scripts together. SQLMesh boasts several future-proof features such as automatic data contracts, virtual data environments and snapshots, extensive change summaries (before updates are applied!) and column-level lineage out of the box.</p>
<p>We walk through an example together to show you how to harness the full potential of your data analytics workflow and how SQLMesh and Ibis can work together hand-in-hand. Read the full article on <a href="https://tobikodata.com/ibis-sqlmesh-unlocking-data-insights.html">SQLMesh blog</a>!</p>
<p>In today’s data-driven world, the ability to efficiently analyze and derive insights from vast amounts of data is paramount. Leveraging powerful open-source tools like SQLMesh and Ibis can streamline this process, enabling you to easily manipulate and query data.</p>
<p>Let us know how you’re using SQLMesh and Ibis together in your use case!</p>

<section id="what-does-schema-mean" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-schema-mean">What does “schema” mean?</h3>
<p>In building a standard Python dataframe interface, we must standardize naming conventions and terminology across data systems. Many systems use the words “schema”, “database”, “catalog”, and “namespace” to mean different things.</p>
<p>In Ibis, a “schema” is a mapping of column names to their types:</p>
<div id="e2ed91aa" class="cell" data-execution_count="7">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1">t.schema()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="6">
<pre><code>ibis.Schema {
  species            string
  island             string
  bill_length_mm     float64
  bill_depth_mm      float64
  flipper_length_mm  int64
  body_mass_g        int64
  sex                string
  year               int64
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And as of Ibis 9.0, that is all “schema” means! We have standardizes on <code>table</code> as the container of data which has a <code>schema</code>. A <code>database</code> is a collection of tables, and a <code>catalog</code> is a collection of databases. Not all backends will support all levels of hierarchy.</p>
<p>Existing methods using the hierarchical meaning of “schema” will now raise a deprecation warning, and the arguments throughout the API have been updated to reflect the standardization.</p>
<p>For example, <code>list_schemas()</code> will give a deprecation warning:</p>

<p>Subject: Urgent: Data Discovery Needed for Critical Analysis</p>
<p>Hi Data Team,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out with an urgent request that directly impacts the company’s most critical project. We need to locate a specific value within our database but do not know which column it’s in. Unfortunately, we don’t have documentation for this particular table. We are looking for the value “NEEDLE” in the table.</p>
<p>We think it is in the X database, Y schema, and Z table. We appreciate your help with this urgent matter!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whelp, let’s give this a try.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-table" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-table">The table</h2>
<p>To set up this particular problem, we can use pandas to create a table with 5 columns and 100 rows. We can use the <code>at</code> method to update a row with the value “NEEDLE” to simulate what we need to find.</p>

<p><code>s.of_type("string")</code> was used to select string columns, then <code>s.if_any()</code> builds up the ORs. The <code>_ == "NEEDLE"</code> part is the condition itself, checking each column for the value.</p>
<p>Here’s the SQL that was generated to help us find it, which is quite similar to what we would have had to write if we had gone with Option 1.</p>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This post showcases how Ibis and <a href="https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/">Hamilton</a> enable dataflows that span execution over SQL and Python. Ibis is a portable dataframe library to write procedural data transformations in Python and be able to execute them directly on various SQL backends (DuckDB, Snowflake, Postgres, Flink, see <a href="https://ibis-project.org/support_matrix">full list</a>). Hamilton provides a declarative way to define testable, modular, self-documenting dataflows, that encode lineage and metadata.</p>
<p>Let’s introduce Ibis before exploring how it pairs with Hamilton.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="standalone-ibis">Standalone Ibis</h2>
<p>Here’s an Ibis code snippet to load data from a parquet file, compute features, select columns, and filter rows, illustrating typical feature engineering operations.</p>
<p>Reading the code, you’ll notice that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We use “expression chaining”, meaning there’s a series of <code>.method()</code> attached one after another.</li>
<li>The variable <code>ibis._</code> is a special character referring to the current expression e.g., <code>ibis._.pet</code> accesses the column “pet” of the current table.</li>
<li>The table method <code>.mutate(col1=, col2=, ...)</code> assigns new columns or overwrites existing ones.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenge-1-maintain-and-test-complex-data-transformations">Challenge 1 – Maintain and test complex data transformations</h3>
<p>Ibis has an SQL-like syntax and supports chaining operations, allowing for powerful queries in a few lines of code. Conversely, there’s a risk of sprawling complexity as expressions are appended, making them harder to test and debug. Preventing this issue requires a lot of upfront discipline and refactoring.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="challenge-2-orchestrate-ibis-code-in-production">Challenge 2 – Orchestrate Ibis code in production</h3>
<p>Ibis alleviates a major pain point by enabling data transformations to work across backends. However, moving from dev to prod still requires some code changes such as changing backend connectors, swapping unsupported operators, adding some orchestration and logging execution, wanting to reuse prior code, etc. This is outside the scope of the Ibis project and is expected to be enabled by other means, which usually means bespoke constructs that turn into technical debt.</p>

<section id="what-is-hamilton" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-hamilton">What is Hamilton?</h2>
<p>Hamilton is a general-purpose framework to write dataflows using regular Python functions. At the core, each function defines a transformation and its parameters indicates its dependencies. Hamilton automatically connects individual functions into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a> (DAG) that can be executed, visualized, optimized, and reported on.</p>

<section id="how-hamilton-complements-ibis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-hamilton-complements-ibis">How Hamilton complements Ibis</h2>
<p>Hamilton was initially developed to <a href="https://blog.dagworks.io/p/tidy-production-pandas-with-hamilton-3b759a2bf562">structure pandas code for a large catalog of features</a>, and has since been adopted by multiple organizations since, and expanded to cover any python object type (Polars, PySpark, ML Models, Numpy, you custom type, etc). Its syntax encourages users to chunk code into meaningful and reusable components, which facilitates documentation, unit testing, code reviews, and improves iteration speed, and the dev to production process. These benefits directly translate to organizing Ibis code.</p>
<section id="solution-1-structure-your-ibis-code-with-hamilton" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solution-1-structure-your-ibis-code-with-hamilton">Solution 1 – Structure your Ibis code with Hamilton</h3>
<p>Now, we’ll refactor the above Ibis code to use Hamilton. Users have the flexibility to chunk code (i.e., what the contents of a function is), at the table or the column-level depending on the needed granularity. This modularity is particularly beneficial to Ibis because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Well-scoped functions with type annotations and docstring are easier to understand for new Ibis users and facilitate onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p>Unit testing and data validation becomes easier with smaller expressions. These checks become more important when working across backends since the <a href="https://ibis-project.org/support_matrix">operation coverage varies</a> and bugs may arise.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="table-level-dataflow" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="table-level-dataflow">Table-level dataflow</h4>
<p>Table-level operations might feel most familiar to SQL and Spark users. Also, Ibis + Hamilton is reminiscent of <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> for the Python ecosystem.</p>
<p>Working with tables is very efficient when your number of columns/features is limited, and you don’t need full column level lineage. As you want to reuse components, you can progressively breakdown “table-level code” in to “column-level code”.</p>
<p>The initial Ibis code is now 3 functions with type annotations and docstrings. We have a clear sense of the expected external outputs and we could implement schema checks between functions.</p>

<p>Hamilton was initially built to expose and manage column-level operations, which is most common in dataframe libraries (pandas, Dask, polars).</p>
<p>Column-level code leads to fully-reusable feature definitions and a highly granular level of lineage. Notably, this allows one to <a href="https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/how-tos/use-hamilton-for-lineage/">trace sensitive data and evaluate downstream impacts of code changes</a>. However, it is more verbose to get started with, but remember that code is read more often than written.</p>
<p>Now, the raw_table is loaded and the columns <code>son</code>, <code>pet</code>, and <code>month_of_absence</code> are extracted to engineer new features. After transformations, features are joined with <code>raw_table</code> to create <code>feature_table</code>.</p>

<section id="solution-2-orchestrate-ibis-anywhere" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="solution-2-orchestrate-ibis-anywhere">Solution 2 – Orchestrate Ibis anywhere</h3>
<p>Hamilton is an ideal way to orchestrate Ibis code because it has a very small dependency footprint and will run anywhere Python does (script, notebook, <a href="https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/integrations/fastapi/">FastAPI</a>, <a href="https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/integrations/streamlit/">Streamlit</a>, pyodide, etc.) In fact, the Hamilton library only has four dependencies. You don’t need “framework code” to get started, just plain Python functions. When moving to production, Hamilton has all the necessary features to complement Ibis such as swapping components, configurations, and lifecycle hooks for logging, alerting, and telemetry.</p>
<p>A simple usage pattern of Hamilton + Ibis is to use the <code>@config.when</code> <a href="https://hamilton.dagworks.io/en/latest/concepts/function-modifiers/#select-functions-to-include">function modifier</a>. In the following example, we have alternative implementations for the backend connection, which will be used for computing and storing results. When running your code, specify in your config <code>backend="duckdb"</code> or <code>backend="bigquery"</code> to swap between the two.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performance-boost">Performance boost</h2>
<p>Leveraging DuckDB as the default backend, Hamilton users migrating to Ibis should immediately find performance improvements both for local dev and production. In addition, the portability of Ibis has the potential to greatly reduce development time.</p>

<p>Hamilton can directly produce a dataflow visualization from code, helping with project documentation. Ibis pushes this one step further by providing a detailed view of the query plan and schemas. See this Ibis visualization for the column-level Hamilton dataflow defined above. It includes all renaming, type casting, and transformations steps (Please open the image in a new tab and zoom in 🔎).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-across-rows-with-user-defined-functions-udfs">Working across rows with user-defined functions (UDFs)</h2>
<p>Hamilton and most backends are designed to work primarily on tables and columns, but sometimes you’d like to operate over a row (think of <code>pd.DataFrame.apply()</code>). However, pivoting tables is costly and manually iterating over rows to collect values and create a new column is quickly inconvenient. By using scalar user-defined functions (UDFs), Ibis makes it possible to execute arbitrary Python code on rows directly on the backend.</p>

<p>Using <code>@ibis.udf.scalar.python</code> creates a non-vectorized function that iterates row-by-row. See <a href="https://ibis-project.org/reference/scalar-udfs">the docs</a> to use backend-specific UDFs with <code>@ibis.udf.scalar.builtin</code> and create vectorized scalar UDFs.</p>

<h1>Ibis + Hamilton – a natural pairing</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>What works in dev works in prod</strong>: Ibis and Hamilton allows you to write and structure code data transformations that are portable across backends for small and big data alike. The two being lightweight libraries, installing dependencies on remote workers is fast and you’re unlikely to ever encounter dependency conflicts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintainable and testable code</strong>: Modular functions facilitates writing high quality code and promotes reusability, compounding your engineering efforts. It becomes easier for new users to contribute to a dataflow and pull requests are merged faster.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Greater visibility</strong>: With Hamilton and Ibis, you have incredible visualizations directly derived from your code. This is a superpower for documentation, allowing users to make sense of a dataflow, and also reason about changes.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-unix-backend-for-ibis">The Unix backend for Ibis</h2>
<p>We’re happy to announce a new Ibis backend built on the world’s best known web scale technology: Unix pipes.</p>
</section>
<section id="why" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Why not? Pipes rock and they automatically stream data between operators and scale to your hard drive.</p>
<p>What’s not to love?</p>

<section id="demo" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>All production ready backends ship with amazing demos.</p>
<p>The Unix backend is no different. Let’s see it in action.</p>
<p>First we’ll install the Unix backend.</p>

<p>Glad you asked!</p>
<p>The Unix backend for Ibis was built over the course of a few hours, which is about the time it takes to make a production ready Ibis backend.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the Unix backend:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Produces a shell command for each Ibis <em>table</em> operation.</li>
<li>Produces a nominal output location for the output of that command, in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe">named pipe</a> opened in write mode.</li>
<li>Reads output from the named pipe output location of the root of the expression tree.</li>
<li>Calls <code>pandas.read_csv</code> on that output.</li>
</ol>

<p>Shell commands only allow a single input from <code>stdin</code>.</p>
<p>However, joins accept &gt; 1 input so we need a way to stream more than one input to a join operation.</p>
<p>Named pipes support the semantics of “unnamed” pipes (FIFO queue behavior) but can be used in pipelines with nodes that have more a single input since they exist as paths on the file system.</p>
</div>
</div>

<section id="expressions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="expressions">Expressions</h3>
<p>Ibis expressions are an abstract representation of an analytics computation over tabular data.</p>
<p>Ibis ships a public API, whose instances we call <em>expressions</em>.</p>
<p>Expressions have an associated type–accessible via their <a href="../../reference/expression-generic.html#ibis.expr.types.generic.Value.type"><code>type()</code></a> method–that determines what methods are available on them.</p>
<p>Expressions are ignorant of their underlying implementation: their composability is determined solely by their type.</p>
<p>This type is determined by the expression’s underlying <em>operation</em>.</p>
<p>The two-layer model makes it easy to describe operations in terms of the data types produced by an expression, rather than as instances of a specific class in a hierarchy.</p>
<p>This allows Ibis maintainers to alter expression API implementations without changing those APIs making it easier to maintain and easier to keep stable than if we had a complex (but not necessarily deep!) class hierarchy.</p>
<p>Operations, though, are really where the nitty gritty implementation details start.</p>
</section>
<section id="operations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="operations">Operations</h3>
<p>Ibis <em>operations</em> are lightweight classes that model the tree structure of a computation.</p>
<p>They have zero or more inputs, whose types and values are constrained by Ibis’s <em>type system</em>.</p>
<p>Notably operations are <em>not</em> part of Ibis’s public API.</p>
<p>When we talk about “compilation” in Ibis, we’re talking about the process of converting an <em>operation</em> into something that the backend knows how to execute.</p>
<p>In the case of this 1̵0̸0̵%̵ p̶̺̑r̴̛ͅo̵̒ͅḍ̴̌u̷͇͒c̵̠̈t̷͍̿i̶̪͐o̸̳̾n̷͓̄-r̵̡̫̞͓͆̂̏ẽ̸̪̱̽ͅā̸̤̹̘̅̓͝d̵͇̞̏̂̔̽y̴̝͎̫̬͋̇̒̅ Unix backend, each operation is compiled into a list of strings that represent the shell command to run to execute the operation.</p>
<p>In other backends, like DuckDB, these compilation rules produce a sqlglot object.</p>
<p>The <code>compile</code> method is also the place where the backend has a chance to invoke custom rewrite rules over operations.</p>
<p>Rewrites are a very useful tool for the Unix backend. For example, the <code>join</code> command (yep, it’s in coreutils!) that we use to execute inner joins with this backend requires that the inputs be sorted, otherwise the results won’t be correct. So, I added a rewrite rule that replaces the left and right relations in a join operation with equivalent relations sorted on the join keys.</p>
<p>Once you obtain the output of compile, it’s up to the backend what to do next.</p>
</section>
<section id="backend-implementation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="backend-implementation">Backend implementation</h3>
<p>At this point we’ve got our shell commands and some output locations created as named pipes.</p>
<p>What next?</p>
<p>Well, we need to execute the commands and write their output to the corresponding named pipe.</p>
<p>You might think</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I’ll just loop over the operations, open the pipe in write mode and call <code>subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=named_pipe)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not a bad thought, but the semantics of named pipes do not abide such thoughts :)</p>
<p>Named pipes, when opened in write mode, will block until a corresponding handle is opened in <em>read</em> mode.</p>
<p>Futures using a scoped thread pool are a decent way to handle this.</p>
<p>The idea is to launch every node concurrently and then read from the last node’s output. This initial read of the root node’s output pipe kicks off the cascade of other reads necessary to move data through the pipeline.</p>
<p>The Unix backend thus constructs a scoped <code>ThreadPoolExecutor()</code> using a context manager and submits a task for each operation to the executor. Importantly, opening the named pipe in write mode happens <strong>inside</strong> the task, to avoid blocking the main thread while waiting for a reader to be opened.</p>
<p>The final output task’s path is then passed directly to <code>read_csv</code>, and we’ve now got the result of our computation.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>We’ve <a href="../../posts/snowflake-io/index.html">blogged about Snowflake IO before</a>, in the context of getting local files into Snowflake as fast as possible.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll show how to insert query results from another system into Snowflake, using Ibis.</p>

<p>Because all Ibis backends implement the <code>to_pyarrow()</code> method, we can get data out of another system and into Snowflake with a few lines of code.</p>
<p>First we’ll create a table in Snowflake to hold the data.</p>
<p>Ibis helps here by providing an API to access the schema from the <strong>postgres</strong>-based expression, and automatically translates postgres types into Snowflake types.</p>

  <title>Analysis of World of Warcraft data</title>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I grew up playing games, and with the recent re-release of World of Warcraft Classic, it seems like a perfect time to analyze some in-game data!</p>
<p>This dataset is the product of a Horde player’s diligent recording throughout 2008, capturing the transitional phase between the Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King expansions. Notably, starting November 13, 2008, the data showcases numerous characters venturing into new territories and advancing beyond the former level cap of 70.</p>
</section>
<section id="analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>We’ll determine who logged in the most, who leveled from 70 to 80 the fastest, and what activities these players engaged with based on zones. Let’s get to work.</p>
<section id="getting-started" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-started">Getting started</h3>
<p>Ibis ships with an <code>examples</code> module, which includes this specific data. We’ll use DuckDB here, but this is possible with other backends, and we encourage you to experiment. DuckDB is the default Ibis backend, so it’ll be easy to use with this example.</p>
<p>You can execute <code>pip install ibis-framework[duckdb,examples]</code> to work with Ibis and the example data.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-leveled-the-fastest-from-7080">Who leveled the fastest from 70–80?</h3>
<p>At the end of the year, there were 884 level 80s. Who leveled the fastest?</p>
<p>Finding this answer will involve filtering, grouping, and aggregating to compute each character’s time taken to level from 70 to 80.</p>
<p>Let’s start by creating an expression to filter to only the level 80 characters, then join it to filter and identify only where they were level 70 or 80. We’re only concerned with three columns so that we will select only those.</p>

<p>This code summarizes how often those characters appear in different zones while leveling up from level 70 to 80. It combines two sets of data based on character names, selects records within the leveling timeframe, groups data by character and zone, and counts the number of times each character was found in each zone.</p>
<p>There is another example table we can join to figure out the Zone information. I’m only interested in two columns, so I’ll filter this further and rename the columns.</p>

  <title>Stream-batch unification through Ibis</title>
  <dc:creator>Chloe He</dc:creator>
  <link>https://ibis-project.org/posts/unified-stream-batch/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>One of my focuses in the past 10 months has been to implement the Flink backend for Ibis. I was working with Apache Flink and building a feature engineering tool, and we stumbled upon Ibis as we attempted to build our own translation layer that could turn user declarations into relation trees, then optimize and deploy the query plan, all while maintaining the underlying infrastructure for the user. We considered and prototyped with a number of tools and eventually chose Ibis. It had already established a position in the batch world and had support for 10+ of the most popular batch engines (at the time). We loved the idea of decoupling the user-facing interface from the execution engine, so that users can swap out the execution engine depending on their needs, without having to rewrite code. And, of course, it was open-source. It was everything we dreamed of.</p>
<p>A few months later, <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/pull/6408">we started introducing Apache Flink as the first streaming backend into Ibis</a>. We saw so much more that Ibis can do when it steps outside of batch.</p>
<p>Ibis 8.0 marks the official launch of the first streaming backends in Ibis (<a href="https://ibis-project.org/backends/flink">Apache Flink</a> and <a href="https://ibis-project.org/backends/risingwave">RisingWave</a>). This is a very significant milestone in Ibis development.</p>
<p>You may be wondering: what does this mean? Why is this such a big deal? I will be answering these questions in this blog post.</p>
<section id="ibis-combines-stream-and-batch-into-a-single-framework-beyond-version-8.0" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ibis-combines-stream-and-batch-into-a-single-framework-beyond-version-8.0">Ibis combines stream and batch into a single framework beyond version 8.0</h2>
<p>Today, Ibis provides support for 20+ backends including Dask, DuckDB, PostgreSQL, PySpark, Snowflake, and others. However - before the introduction of Flink and RisingWave backends - all of the supported backends derive from a batch paradigm (aside from Spark, which does offer support for stream processing, albeit using micro-batches underneath the hood).</p>
<p>This means that Ibis is an extremely valuable tool, but it was limited to batch workloads. In the case of streaming workloads, where systems are <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-101/">designed with unbounded data in mind</a>, the batch-oriented Ibis fell short. To deal with an infinite data stream, streaming data systems operate with unique concepts such as “event time”, “processing time”, “watermark”, etc. All of these were missing from Ibis.</p>
<p>At the same time, streaming systems (Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, RisingWave, etc) have been gaining popularity. It drove the development of more mature technologies as well as new approaches to close the gap between batch and streaming worlds. <a href="https://www.ververica.com/blog/apache-flink-sql-past-present-and-future">Flink SQL, for example, was born as a part of such effort and, through allowing users to write streaming engines in a SQL-like manner, have been vastly successful in that regard.</a> The success of Flink SQL both validates the potential of stream and batch unification and inspires the community to push for better standards, a vision that Ibis is at a unique and valuable position to help build.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-is-batch-stream-unification-significant" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-is-batch-stream-unification-significant">Why is batch-stream unification significant?</h2>
<p>Firstly, large companies that have both batch and streaming workloads often deploy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture">Lambda architecture</a>. In a Lambda infrastructure, batch and streaming pipelines are separate, which requires two codebases to be set up and maintained. If you’re a platform engineer, you have probably found yourself trying to duplicate batch workloads “in streaming code” and vice versa. If you have backfilled a streaming pipeline due to a bug and needed to reimplement the logic on a batch pipeline, you know how painful that all is :(</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/data-streaming-processing/unified-streaming-and-batch-pipelines-at-linkedin-reducing-proc">LinkedIn successfully reduced processing time by 94% and resource utilization by 50% after switching from a Lambda architecture to unified batch and streaming pipelines.</a> A unified system also massively increased engineer productivity because they no longer needed to develop and maintain separate codebases for different environments. <a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/kappa-architecture-data-stream-processing/">Uber</a>, <a href="https://www.ververica.com/blog/apache-flinks-stream-batch-unification-powers-alibabas-11.11-in-2020">Alibaba</a>, and <a href="https://beam.apache.org/case-studies/lyft/">Lyft</a> have also adopted similar solutions.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the world of machine learning, it’s common for data scientists to develop locally and experiment with a sampled, batch dataset in Python. If the results look promising, the features and models would then be deployed into production. Oftentimes, there is a code handover in this process, and a dedicated team of developers would be responsible for rewriting the logic for production, as a streaming workload.</p>
<p>In both cases, there is a huge amount of technical overhead. If there is a streamlined architecture, using a unified API, much of this overhead can be avoided. As a platform engineer, you no longer need to worry about maintaining two separate architectures and codebases. As a data scientist or a machine learning engineer, you can write one single workload that can execute both on batch and streaming backends. Wouldn’t that be amazing?</p>

<section id="ibis-unifies-batch-and-streaming" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ibis-unifies-batch-and-streaming">Ibis unifies batch and streaming</h2>
<p>Enter Ibis. Ibis unifies batch and streaming with a single API. It decouples the dataframe API from backend execution, so that the logic for defining data transformations is unaffected by implementation discrepancies across backend engines. There is also an ongoing effort to further increase interoperability across different languages and systems via a standard query plan intermediate representation (IR), using a library called <a href="https://substrait.io/"><code>Substrait</code></a>.</p>
<p>What does this actually look like? For example, Ibis allows users to define window aggregations using the <a href="../../reference/expression-tables.html#ibis.expr.types.groupby.GroupedTable.over"><code>over()</code> method</a>. When executed on the Flink backend, this translates into <a href="https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/dev/table/sql/queries/over-agg/">Flink’s over aggregation query</a> and outputs an aggregated value for every input row over a range of ordered rows. On streaming data, aggregation results are continuously computed and written into data sinks (e.g., Kafka, Redis) as records are received at and consumed from the upstream data source (e.g., Kafka, Change Data Capture). In pandas, the conceptual analog is <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/window.html">windowing operation</a>. Results are computed by looking back the length of the window from the current observation, but can be computed all at once because batch data is static.</p>
<p>Another great example is deduplication. In Flink SQL, this looks something like this:</p>

<p>Prerequisites for running this example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker Compose: This tutorial uses Docker Compose to manage an Apache Kafka environment (including sample data generation) and a Flink cluster (for remote execution). You can <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">download and install Docker Compose from the official website</a>.</li>
<li>JDK 11 release: Flink requires Java 11.</li>
<li>Python 3.9 or 3.10.</li>
<li>Follow <a href="../../tutorials/open-source-software/apache-flink/0_setup.html">the setup tutorial</a> to install the Flink backend for Ibis.</li>
<li>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/realtime-fraud-detection">example repository</a>.</li>

<p>The default execution engine for Ibis is DuckDB.</p>

</div>
<p>This is a series of records of order transactions. At Company Potclay, we have just deployed a new ad campaign, which is A/B tested by province, and we’re interested in the effectiveness of this ad campaign by monitoring data distribution shift over time. A crucial feature is the total transaction amount over the past minute, stratified by province. We would like to first experiment writing this feature on a smaller set of batch data. After we make sure that the logic looks correct and handles all edge cases appropriately, we want to deploy this as a streaming workload.</p>
<p>Ibis allows us to write transformations on top of so-called abstract or unbound tables (i.e., tables that are not bound to an actual data source). This separation between transformation logic and the underlying data and execution is one of the things that makes Ibis so powerful. It’s similar to dependency injection, but in this case the data is the dependency and is injected at runtime.</p>
<p>To write transformations on top of an unbound table, we need to first define an <code>ibis.table()</code> with a schema. Here is how we would write all of this in Ibis code:</p>

<p>For local experimentation purposes, this DataFrame only consists of 100 rows, so doing this in memory is easy.</p>
<p>The outputs look correct and we didn’t run into any errors. We are now ready to deploy this as a streaming job in Flink!</p>
<p>First, let’s set up the Flink environment and connect to this Kafka source:</p>

<p>How easy was it to define both batch and streaming workloads using Ibis? Without Ibis, you would have needed to write a <code>pandas</code>/DuckDB workload and then convert it into Flink SQL manually.</p>
</section>
<section id="concluding-thoughts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>With the introduction of the first streaming backends, Ibis is now both a batch and a streaming Python DataFrame API and we’re excited about what’s to come next. We hope that Ibis can close the gap between batch and streaming in such a way that we no longer talk about the two separately, but, rather, as two parts of the same paradigm. Streaming naturally lends itself to batch: batch is technically just a special case of streaming, where the unbounded data flow stops at some point.</p>
<p>Of course, this is only the beginning. There are still technical challenges to be solved (e.g., backfill, window computations over large windows, GPU acceleration), and we’ll definitely have more exciting updates to share with the community soon!</p>
<p>Check out the new <a href="https://ibis-project.org/backends/flink">Apache Flink</a> and <a href="https://ibis-project.org/backends/risingwave">RisingWave</a> backends and let us know what you think!</p>

  <title>Using DuckDB + Ibis for RAG</title>
  <dc:creator>Cody Peterson</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this post, we’ll demonstrate traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with DuckDB and OpenAI via Ibis and discuss the pros and cons. Notice that because Ibis is portable, you can use (almost) any database Ibis supports for RAG!</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled" title="Which databases can I use?">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">

</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Which databases can I use?
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The database must support array types and have some form of similarity metric between arrays of numbers. Alternatively, a custom user-defined function (UDF) can be used for the similarity metric.</p>
<p>The performance of calculating similarity will also be much faster if the database supports <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/data_types/array">fixed-sized arrays</a> as DuckDB recently launched in version 0.10.0. We’re still using 0.9.2 in this post, but it’ll be easy to upgrade.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../../posts/why-duckdb/index.html">DuckDB is the default backend for Ibis</a> and makes rapid prototyping locally very easy. You can deploy it to <a href="https://motherduck.com">MotherDuck</a> just by changing the connection string, or swap out DuckDB for another Ibis backend.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-rag" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-rag">What is RAG?</h2>
<p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique for language model systems to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base, augment the model’s input with that knowledge, and then generate a response. It serves to provide useful context given language models’ context length limitations and increase the quality of the response.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-note callout-titled" title="Is RAG dead?">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Is RAG dead?
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>With increasing language model context lengths, is RAG dead?</p>
<p><strong>No</strong>. Though as we’ll discuss later, it’s unclear if traditional vector similarity search RAG is the best approach. Regardless, just because a language model can use the entire content of a textbook doesn’t mean you’ll get better performance (accuracy or efficiency) than first retrieving the relevant subsets of the textbook.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Traditional RAG embeds text into vectors of numbers and then computes a similarity metric between input text and the knowledge base to determine the most relevant context.</p>

<p>Now we have a DuckDB database with the <code>ibis</code> table containing all the file paths and contents of the Quarto markdown files in the <code>ibis</code> repository. You can adjust this code to work with any repository and any file type(s)! For instance, we may also want to ingest all the <code>.py</code> files in the Ibis repsoitory.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embedding-text-to-vectors">Embedding text to vectors</h3>
<p>To search for similar text in traditional RAG fashion, we need to <strong>embed</strong> the text into vectors. We can use <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models">OpenAI’s embedding models</a> to perform this step.</p>
<p>Note that the maximum length of input <strong>tokens</strong> is 8,191. A word typically consists of 1-3 tokens. To estimate the number of tokens of a string in Python, we can divide the length of that string by 4. This isn’t perfect, but will work for now. Let’s augmented our data with the estimated number of tokens and sort from largest to smallest:</p>

<p>The longest text is certainly over our embedding model’s token limit, and the second longest might be as well. In practice, we’d want to chunk our text into smaller pieces. This is its own challenge, but for the purposes of this demonstration we’ll just ignore text that is too long.</p>

<p>Notice there was one error – that second row’s content was indeed too long! Our token estimate is a bit off, but overall useful. We accounted for this possibility in our Python UDF above, returning <code>None</code> (mapped to <code>NULL</code> in DuckDB) when the text is too long or an error occurs.</p>

<p>Cosine similarity over vectors is a common way to measure similarity for RAG applications. We’ll explore its downsides later. We need to make Ibis aware of DuckDB’s built-in <code>list_cosine_similarity</code> function:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rag-pitfalls">RAG pitfalls</h2>
<p>As in traditional software engineering and machine learning, the architecture when building systems around language models is not a universal. The best depends on the application of the system. Using cosine (or otherwise) similarity search over text transformed to numbers may not always perform best.</p>
<p>We can demonstrate this with the following scenario: let’s assume we’re building a chatbot that writes and runs SQL on the user’s behalf based on their questions posed in English (or any language the language model understand sufficiently). We might store past queries, the SQL generated, and some evaluation criteria (upvote/downvote on the generated SQL from the user) in a database. Then we can use the same RAG approach above to augment our queries with the user’s past queries and the generated SQL.</p>
<p>Take the following English query:</p>
<div id="cc91ed9c" class="cell" data-execution_count="19">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb13" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb13-1">a <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"""the first 10 rows of the penguins, ordered by body_mass_g from</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2"><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">lightest to heaviest"""</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can compute the cosine similarity of this query against itself, resulting in 1.0 or close to it:</p>
<div id="9ec65ea2" class="cell" data-execution_count="20">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb14" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb14-1">list_cosine_similarity(_embed(a), _embed(a))</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display">
<pre style="white-space:pre;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"></pre>
</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="20">
<div class="ansi-escaped-output">
<pre><span class="ansi-cyan-fg ansi-bold">0.9999994546885027</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s flip the ordering. This would result in an entirely different SQL query and result set:</p>
<div id="feb65948" class="cell" data-execution_count="21">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb15" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb15-1">b <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">=</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"""the first 10 rows of the penguins, ordered by body_mass_g from</span></span>
<span id="cb15-2"><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;

<p>And compute the cosine similarity of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>:</p>

<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="22">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Similarly, we can construct a semantically equivalent query that would result in the same SQL as example <code>a</code>:</p>
<div id="5b7538bd" class="cell" data-execution_count="23">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb17" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb17-1">c <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;

<span id="cb17-2"><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">sorted from biggest to smallest by weight"""</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>That has a much lower cosine similarity in the embedding space:</p>
<div id="e0b9ca7b" class="cell" data-execution_count="24">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb18" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb18-1">list_cosine_similarity(_embed(a), _embed(c))</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display">
<pre style="white-space:pre;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace"></pre>
</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="24">
<div class="ansi-escaped-output">
<pre><span class="ansi-cyan-fg ansi-bold">0.5682471739636249</span></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Despite semantic equivalence, these two queries would not be considered similar. You need to be careful and understand what the system is doing.</p>

<p>Is traditional RAG the best approach? It’s unclear, and <strong>it depends</strong>.</p>
<section id="system-architecture" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="system-architecture">System architecture</h3>
<p>Often RAG-based systems introduce yet-another-database to store the embeddings. Hopefully this post has demonstrated that traditional database options can work just fine. While we’re only demonstrating this on a few rows here, DuckDB can scale up to many millions with ease.</p>

<section id="cost-and-speed" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cost-and-speed">Cost and speed</h3>
<p>The cost of running this demo from OpenAI is less than $0.01 USD. It also runs in about a minute, but with many rows this would be much slower. You need to consider your architecture here. One option would be using an open source embedding model that can run locally. Swap out the OpenAI calls with that and see how it goes!</p>

<section id="alternatives-to-vector-search-rag" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alternatives-to-vector-search-rag">Alternatives to vector search RAG</h3>
<p>It’s clear that we should always be augmenting our language model calls with the most relevant context, even if traditional vector search RAG is not the best solution. The problem then becomes the best way to retrieve that context for a given system’s desired behavior.</p>

<p>“I would like to abolish the term RAG and instead just agree that we should always try to provide models with the appropriate context to provide high quality answers.” - <a href="https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1709740984643596768">Hamel Husain</a></p>

<p>Some alternatives to vector search RAG include:</p>
<ul>
<li>traditional search methods</li>
<li>using an external web search engine</li>
<li>using a language model for search</li>
</ul>
<p>The last point is particularly interesting – in the above examples with <code>a</code> and <code>c</code> strings, cosine similarity in the embedding space could not tell the queries are semantically equivalent. However, a sufficiently good language model certainly could. As we demonstrated in <a href="../../posts/lms-for-data/index.html">language models for data</a>, we could even setup a classifier and use <a href="https://www.askmarvin.ai/docs/text/classification/#classifying-text">the logit bias trick</a> to compute similarity with a single output token.</p>
<p>This trick makes the language model faster, but for practical applications the cost and speed of language models for search is still a concern. We can expect this concern to be mitigated over time as language models become faster and cheaper to run.</p>
<p>With larger context lengths, we could also use an initial call to a language model to extract out relevant sections of text and then make a second call with that augmented context.</p>

  <title>Why is DuckDB the default backend for Ibis?</title>
  <dc:creator>Phillip Cloud</dc:creator>
  <link>https://ibis-project.org/posts/why-duckdb/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="why-duckdb" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-duckdb">Why DuckDB?</h2>
<p>Occasionally people ask us why DuckDB is the default backend.</p>
<p>This blog posts aims to address this question.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-bit-of-history" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-bit-of-history">A bit of history</h2>
<p>For years, Ibis had no default backend. We had somewhat hidden functionality to read parquet files with pandas, but no one working on the project at the time was comfortable making pandas execution the default.</p>
<p>pandas is great, but we didn’t want to inherit all of its <a href="https://wesmckinney.com/blog/apache-arrow-pandas-internals/">technical baggage</a> for users, especially new users, of Ibis.</p>
<p>So, we decided to not make any backend the official default because our primary option for local execution wouldn’t give users a good out-of-the-box experience.</p>
</section>
<section id="duckdb" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="duckdb">DuckDB</h2>
<p>DuckDB came along as the new kid on the block a few years ago, offering the uber-convenience of SQLite but for analytic use cases. It came with excellent performance to boot.</p>
<p>It also had a thriving open source community and was built on a solid foundation of decades of academic database research, both of which made us all optimistic about its future.</p>
<p>It is an <strong>excellent</strong> engine for a use case that is critical for a great experience when using Ibis: executing SQL against local data. In particular, DuckDB handles larger-than-memory CSV, Apache Parquet, and JSON files with aplomb.</p>
<p>It was also a big plus that it had entry and exit points for existing ecosystem tools like Apache Arrow, and yes, pandas.</p>
</section>
<section id="fast-forward-to-today" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fast-forward-to-today">Fast forward to today</h2>
<p>DuckDB is now the <strong>primary</strong> recommended Ibis backend for working with local data.</p>
<p>After we release 9.0, the DuckDB backend will surpass all of our other local backends in both performance and feature set, including AS OF JOIN support.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-about-other-backends" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-about-other-backends">What about other backends?</h2>
<p>At the <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/tree/8ccb81d49e252b57310bdb3a97eeb77ef1d28bac">time we made the decision</a> to make DuckDB the default backend we had a few other options:</p>
<section id="dask" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dask">Dask</h3>
<p>Dask is great, but also inherits the technical baggage of pandas, the least desirable aspect of which is pandas type instability.</p>
<p>We think that users should be able to handle strings and nulls without worrying about the NULL/NaN problem that every pandas and Dask user must grapple with.</p>
</section>
<section id="datafusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="datafusion">DataFusion</h3>
<p>DataFusion continues to improve year over year, but at the time we were choosing a default backend it wasn’t feature complete enough for us to choose it as the default.</p>
<p>It’s still lacking some important functionality that DuckDB has had since its early days:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>UNNEST</code></li>
<li><code>GREATEST</code> and <code>LEAST</code></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="pandas" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pandas">pandas</h3>
<p>Earlier I mentioned the technical baggage of pandas.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Type instability. Introducing a NULL into an integer column causes an upcast to float.</li>
<li>A very complex set of combinations of possible types. For example, there are three kinds of NULL values in pandas and three kinds of integer arrays to use as backing storage for a <code>Series</code> object.</li>
<li>Extremely undesirable memory allocation behavior. We didn’t want to have to give users a rule of thumb about how much extra memory to have around to ensure their workload would complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another challenge with choosing pandas is that it makes iterating between development and production more difficult, because pandas diverges quite a lot from most production analytics databases.</p>
</section>
<section id="pyspark" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pyspark">PySpark</h3>
<p>We didn’t think it was desirable to saddle users with a distributed system and a JVM to analyze local files.</p>
</section>
<section id="sqlite" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sqlite">SQLite</h3>
<p>SQLite is a wonderful tool, but it has a number of properties that make it unsuitable for analytics out of the box:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Weak typing. This has consequences for storage and memory allocation. In particular, efficient conversions to and from Apache Arrow are not possible.</li>
<li>No native complex type support, JSON doesn’t really count, see the previous point.</li>
<li>Generally joins are slow unless your join key columns are indexed.</li>
</ol>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>DuckDB is the primary default backend because it fits our requirements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Great performance for local data</li>
<li>A thriving open source community</li>
<li>A solid foundation</li>
<li>A large and well-supported feature set</li>
</ol>
<p>We are excited to see DuckDB continue to grow and evolve, and we are excited to work with the community to make Ibis the premier Python DataFrame API!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the first public roadmap for the Ibis project! If you aren’t familiar with the background of Ibis or who supports it nowadays, we recommend reading <a href="../../posts/why-voda-supports-ibis/index.html">why Voltron Data supports Ibis</a> before the roadmap below.</p>
</section>
<section id="roadmap-github-project" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="roadmap-github-project">Roadmap GitHub project</h2>
<p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ibis-project/projects/5">public roadmap as a GitHub project!</a> You can follow along with specific higher-level issues you are interested in there to keep track of our progress.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>We are early in our use of this GitHub project so please pardon any disorganization as we get it up and running efficiently. We have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roadmap view</strong>: consisting of meta-issues in their respective repositories for high-level objectives of the Ibis project</li>
<li><strong>Triage view</strong>: consisting of new issues across Ibis project repositories that need to be triaged</li>
<li><strong>Backlog view</strong>: consisting of issues that have been triaged (assigned a priority) and are on the backlog</li>
<li><strong>TODO view</strong>: consisting of issues that are in progress or ready to be worked on soon</li>
<li><strong>Label-specific views</strong>: consisting of issues for specific labels, like documentation or a large refactor</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now, <a href="../../posts/why-voda-supports-ibis/index.html#who-are-the-core-contributors">the team at Voltron Data</a> sets the roadmap and priorities. Over time as more contributors and organizations join the project, we expect this process to diversify and become more community-driven. We’d love to have you involved in the process! <a href="https://ibis-project.zulipchat.com">Join us on Zulip</a> or interact with us on <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis">GitHub</a> to get involved and join the decision making process for Ibis.</p>

<p>Repeating from <a href="../../posts/why-voda-supports-ibis/index.html">Why Voltron Data supports Ibis</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/governance">Ibis is independently governed</a> and not owned by Voltron Data. Currently, four out of five members of the steering committee are employed by Voltron Data (the fifth being at Alphabet working on Google BigQuery). We are working toward a more diverse representation of companies and organizations as the project continues to grow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Voltron Data also welcomes this dilution of power and influence! A healthy open source project is one that is not controlled by a single entity. This is true of <a href="https://arrow.apache.org">Apache Arrow</a> and other open source projects that Voltron Data employees have been instrumental in building.</p>
</blockquote>

</section>
<section id="main-themes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="main-themes">Main themes</h2>
<p>Our top five themes for 2024 include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Ibis backends</strong>: Ibis is a Python frontend for many backends. To continue scaling to more backends, we need to complete a major rework of library internals and stabilize the API for backend authors. Related work in this area will make it easier than ever to create new Ibis backends and maintain them. This work will also include improving backend interfaces for operations like table creation, insertion, and upsertion. This theme allows Ibis to deliver on the promise of a single Python dataframe API that can be written once and run on any execution engine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ibis for ML</strong>: Increasingly, data projects are ML projects. Ibis can uniquely help with feature engineering and other ML tasks connecting your data where it lives to ML models. We will continue to improve Ibis for ML use cases. This theme allows Ibis to cover more of the data and MLOps lifecycle, with efficient feature engineering and handoff to ML training frameworks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ibis for streaming data</strong>: Ibis has only been for batch data until very recently. With the addition of the first streaming backends, we will continue to improve Ibis for streaming data use cases and bridge the gap between batch and streaming data. This theme allows Ibis to expand its promise of a single Python dataframe to stream processing, too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ibis for geospatial</strong>: Ibis has a rich set of geospatial expressions, but most backends do not implement them. We will continue to improve Ibis for geospatial use cases and bridge the gap between geospatial data and other data types. This theme allows Ibis to cover more of the data lifecycle for geospatial data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ibis community</strong>: Ibis is an open source project and we want to make it as easy as possible for new contributors to get involved. We will continue to improve the Ibis community and make it easier than ever to contribute to Ibis. This theme is critical for Ibis to continue to grow and thrive as an open source project. We aim to delight our community and make it easy to get involved.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We believe these themes will help Ibis as a standard Python interface for many backends and real-world data use cases.</p>
<section id="the-big-refactor" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-big-refactor">The big refactor</h3>
<p>The biggest item in Q1 2024 and primary focus of the core Ibis team right now is the big refactor – dubbed “the epic split” – continuing the great work completed by Krisztián in <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/pull/7752">his PR splitting the relational operations</a>. You can read more details in that PR, but the gist is that a new intermediary representation for Ibis expressions is being has been created that drastically simplifies the codebase.</p>
<p>With that refactor in place, each backend Ibis supports needs to be moved to the new relational model. As a consequence, we are also swapping out SQLAlchemy for <a href="https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot">SQLGlot</a>. We are losing out on some of the things SQLAlchemy did for us automatically, but overall this gives us a lot more control over the SQL that is generated, reduces dependency overhead, and simplifies the codebase further. This <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/pull/8310">was recently merged into main</a> and will be released in Ibis 9.0.</p>

<section id="ibis-for-ml-preprocessing-and-feature-engineering" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ibis-for-ml-preprocessing-and-feature-engineering">Ibis for ML preprocessing and feature engineering</h3>
<p>Data projects are increasingly ML projects. pandas and scikit-learn are the default for Python users, but tend to lack scalability. Many projects look to address this and Ibis does not intend on duplicating effort here. Instead, we want to leverage what sets Ibis apart – the ability to have a single Python API that scales across many backends – to feature engineering and other ML preprocessing tasks ahead of model training.</p>
<p>Jim took this on over the last few months, building up the <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibisml">IbisML</a> package to a usable (but still early) state. We will further invest in IbisML this year to get it to a production-ready state, bringing the power of Ibis to ML preprocessing and feature engineering.</p>
<p>We’re <a href="https://voltrondata.com/resources/voltron-data-acquires-claypot-ai">excited to welcome the (former) Claypot AI team to Voltron Data</a> to help drive this work forward! Expect a release announcement for IbisML soon covering the majority of feature engineering operations and handoff to popular ML training frameworks.</p>

<section id="streaming-data-backends" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="streaming-data-backends">Streaming data backends</h3>
<p>With the <a href="../../posts/ibis-version-8.0.0-release/index.html">release of Ibis 8.0</a>, we added support for Apache Flink in collaboration with Claypot AI, the first dedicated streaming data backend for Ibis. We are also excited to have the (former) Claypot team helping us drive this forward!</p>
<p>We’ve also collaborated with <a href="https://risingwave.com/">RisingWave</a> on the second streaming backend, also released in Ibis 8.0. This backend is still early and fairly experimental, but demonstrates the ability for Ibis to quickly add new backends. We can now add batch and streaming backend with ease!</p>
<p>We will continue to improve Ibis for streaming data use cases and bridge the gap in the dataframe API experience between batch and streaming data. This may mean new backends, though we expect to focus on improving the existing backends and the API for streaming data. If you’re interested in contributing to Ibis and have expertise in a streaming engine, a new streaming backend is a great way to get involved!</p>
</section>
<section id="geospatial-improvements" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="geospatial-improvements">Geospatial improvements</h3>
<p>Ibis supports <a href="https://ibis-project.org/reference/expression-geospatial">50+ geospatial expressions</a> in the API, but most backends do not implement them. We will continue to improve the coverage for geospatial operations across backends. <a href="../../posts/ibis-duckdb-geospatial/index.html">Naty recently added support in the DuckDB backend</a>, making Ibis a great option for local geospatial analysis.</p>

<p>We would love to onboard new contributors to the project.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="other-themes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="other-themes">Other themes</h2>
<p>We have a few other themes for 2024 that are lower priority.</p>
<section id="new-backends" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="new-backends">New backends</h3>
<p>Adding new backends is not a priority for the Ibis team at Voltron Data in Q1. Instead, we are focusing on the big refactor and other internal library improvements to get Ibis to the point where adding new backends is much easier and maintanable. That will take the form of stabilizing the new intermediary representation, separating out <strong>connection</strong> from <strong>compilation</strong> steps, and solidifying the API for backend authors. We will also introduce new documentation and possibly testing frameworks to ease the burden of adding new backends.</p>
<p>We are still happy to support new backends! With contributions from the community, we have recently added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Flink</li>
<li>Exasol</li>
<li>RisingWave</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding a new backend is a great way to get involved with Ibis! If you’re interested, <a href="https://ibis-project.zulipchat.com">join us on Zulip</a> and let us know or <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/issues/new/choose">open an issue on GitHub</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="logo-and-website-design" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="logo-and-website-design">Logo and website design</h3>
<p>We will likely redesign the logo (initially created by Tim Swast, thanks Tim! It has served us well!) and website theme. We aim to keep the website simple and focused on documentation that helps users, but want to deviate from the default themes in Quarto to make Ibis stand out.</p>

<p>A few months ago, we moved our documentation to <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a> and revamped most of the website along the way. We will continue improving the documentation with backend-specific getting started tutorials, how-to guides for common tasks, improved API references, improving the website search functionality, and more!</p>
<p>Improving the documentation is a great way to get involved with Ibis!</p>

<p>This writeup of our roadmap is heavily focused on Q1 of 2024. Looking beyond, our priorities remain much the same. After the big refactor is done, we will continue improving our library internals, backend interface, and ensuring the longevity of Ibis. We’ll continue improving ML, streaming, and geospatial support.</p>
<p>Expect an updated roadmap blog in the second half of the year for more details!</p>

  <title>Ibis goes real-time! Introducing the new Flink backend for Ibis</title>
  <dc:creator>Deepyaman Datta</dc:creator>
  <link>https://ibis-project.org/posts/flink-announcement/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Ibis 8.0 marks the official release of the Apache Flink backend for Ibis. Ibis users can now manipulate data across streaming and batch contexts using the same interface. Flink is one of the most established stream-processing frameworks out there and a central part of the real-time data infrastructure at companies like DoorDash, LinkedIn, Netflix, and Uber. It is commonly applied in use cases such as fraud detection, anomaly detection, real-time recommendation, dynamic pricing, and online advertising. The Flink backend is also the first streaming backend Ibis supports. Follow along as we define and execute a simple streaming job using Ibis!</p>

<section id="installation-prerequisites" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installation-prerequisites">Installation prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker Compose:</strong> This tutorial uses Docker Compose to manage an Apache Kafka environment (including sample data generation) and a Flink cluster (for remote execution). You can <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">download and install Docker Compose from the official website</a>.</li>
<li><strong>JDK 11:</strong> Flink requires Java 11. If you don’t already have JDK 11 installed, you can <a href="https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jdk&amp;version=11">get the appropriate Eclipse Temurin release</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Python:</strong> To follow along, you need Python 3.9 or 3.10.</li>
</ul>

  <title>Ibis 8.0: streaming and more!</title>
  <dc:creator>Ibis team</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Ibis 8.0 marks the first release of stream processing backends in Ibis! This enhances <a href="../../concepts/composable-ecosystem.html">the composable data ecosystem vision</a> by allowing users to implement data transformation logic in a standard Python dataframe API and execute it against either batch or streaming systems.</p>
<p>This release includes <a href="https://flink.apache.org/">Apache Flink</a>, a streaming backend, and <a href="https://risingwave.com">RisingWave</a>, a streaming database backend. We’ve also added a new batch backend with <a href="https://exasol.com">Exasol</a>, bringing the total number of backends Ibis supports to 20.</p>
<p>Most geospatial operations are now supported in the DuckDB backend, making Ibis a great local option for geospatial analytics.</p>
<section id="what-is-stream-processing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-stream-processing">What is stream processing?</h3>
<p>Stream processing systems are designed to handle high-throughput, low-latency data processing with time semantics. They are used to process data in real-time with minimum latency and are often used in applications such as fraud detection, real-time analytics, and IoT. Systems using stream processing are increasingly common in modern data applications.</p>
<p>Apache Flink is the most popular open-source stream processing framework, with numerous cloud options. RisingWave is an open-source Postgres-compatible streaming database with a cloud offering that is gaining popularity and simplifies the streaming experience.</p>
<p>Ibis now supports both and going forward can add more streaming backends to unify the Python user experience across batch and streaming systems.</p>
</section>
<section id="unifying-batch-and-streaming-ux-in-python" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unifying-batch-and-streaming-ux-in-python">Unifying batch and streaming UX in Python</h3>
<p>Whether you’re using a batch or streaming data platform – and the lines are continually blurring between them – you’ll need a frontend to interact with as a data engineer, analyst, or scientist. If you’re using Python, that frontend is likely a dataframe API.</p>
<p>Standards benefit individual users by reducing the cognitive load of learning and understanding new data systems. Organizations benefit from this in the form of lower onboarding costs, easier collaboration between teams, and better interfaces for data systems.</p>
<p>We saw in the recent <a href="../../posts/1brc/index.html#setup-1">one billion row challenge post how even CSV reader keyword arguments can differ greatly between APIs</a>. This is compounded by tightly coupling a dataframe API to every query engine, whether batch or streaming.</p>
<p>Ibis aims to solve this dilemma by providing a standard dataframe API that can work across data systems, whether batch or streaming. This is a long-term vision and we’re excited to take the first steps toward it in Ibis 8.0 with the launch of <strong>two</strong> streaming backends (and one more batch backend).</p>
<p>This allows a user to leverage DuckDB or Polars or DataFusion locally, then scale out batch processing to Snowflake or BigQuery or ClickHouse in the cloud, then switch from batch to stream processing with Apache Flink or RisingWave, all without changing their dataframe code. As Ibis adds new features and implements them across backends, users can take advantage of these features without needing to learn new APIs.</p>

<section id="backends" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="backends">Backends</h2>
<p>Three new backends were added in this release.</p>
<section id="apache-flink" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="apache-flink">Apache Flink</h3>
<p>In collaboration with Claypot AI (<a href="https://voltrondata.com/resources/voltron-data-acquires-claypot-ai">recently acquired by Voltron Data</a>), we’ve added the <a href="../../backends/flink.html">first streaming backend with Apache Flink</a>. You can check out the <a href="../../posts/flink-announcement/index.html">blog post</a> and <a href="../../tutorials/open-source-software/apache-flink/0_setup.html">tutorial</a> to get started with this new backend.</p>
</section>
<section id="risingwave" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="risingwave">RisingWave</h3>
<p><a href="https://risingwave.com">RisingWave</a> has contributed <a href="../../backends/risingwave.html">second streaming backend with RisingWave</a>. This backend is earlier in development, but we’re excited to have it in Ibis and it will continue to improve it.</p>

<section id="exasol" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exasol">Exasol</h3>
<p><a href="https://exasol.com">Exasol</a> has contributed the <a href="../../backends/exasol.html">Exasol backend</a>. This is a traditional batch backend and brings another great option for fast batch analytics to Ibis.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Ibis, see <a href="../../../install.qmd">how to install</a> and <a href="../../../tutorials/getting_started.qmd">the getting started tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>To follow along with this blog, ensure you’re on <code>'ibis-framework&gt;=8,&lt;9'</code>. First, we’ll setup Ibis and fetch some sample data to use.</p>

<p>The largest breaking change in Ibis 7/8 is the deprecation of <code>relabel</code> in favor of <code>rename</code>, swapping the order of the arguments. This change was made to be consistent with the rest of the Ibis API. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we believe this change will make Ibis a better and more consistent dataframe standard going forward.</p>
<p>In the past, you would use <code>relabel</code> like this:</p>

<p>Ibis supports over 50 geospatial operations, with many being recently added to DuckDB backend. While backend-specific, this is worth calling out because it brings a great local option for geospatial analytics to Ibis. <a href="../../posts/ibis-duckdb-geospatial/index.html">Read the first geospatial blog</a> or <a href="../../posts/ibis-duckdb-geospatial-dev-guru/index.html">the second geospatial blog</a> to learn more.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Ibis project is an <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/governance">independently governed</a> open source community project to build and maintain <strong>the portable Python dataframe library</strong>. Ibis has <a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/graphs/contributors">contributors</a> across a range of data companies and institutions. Today the core Ibis maintainers are employed by <a href="https://voltrondata.com">Voltron Data</a>. Voltron Data’s support of Ibis is a part of its strategy to enable modular and composable systems for data analytics.</p>
</section>
<section id="background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The Ibis project was started in 2015 by <a href="https://wesmckinney.com">Wes McKinney</a>, the creator of pandas and a cofounder of Voltron Data, as a pandas-like interface to Apache Impala. It received improvements and support over the years, but really took off under the stewardship of <a href="https://github.com/cpcloud">Phillip Cloud</a> and the current Ibis team at Voltron Data. It now supports 20+ backends and is improving rapidly. It’s never been a better time to get involved with Ibis.</p>
<p>You can see the inflection point in the number of commits to the repository in early 2022:</p>

<p>My name is Cody and I’m employed by Voltron Data to work on Ibis full-time as a Technical Product Manager. I am an Ibis contributor and have created the Delta Lake table input/output methods, helped move the documentation over to <a href="https://quarto.org">Quarto</a>, and created the <a href="https://ibis-project.zulipchat.com">Zulip chat</a> for the community.</p>
<p>My job is to help the Ibis community grow and thrive. I have a background in ML (especially MLOps) and data products. Ibis solves many challenges I’ve seen in the data space and I’m excited to help increase its adoption as a standard Python frontend for dozens of data backends to reduce friction in the data ecosystem.</p>

<p>Voltron Data is a startup company founded in 2021 with the goal of making it possible for organizations to build modular, composable, high-performance systems for data analytics. Voltron Data advances open standards (like <a href="https://arrow.apache.org">Apache Arrow</a> and <a href="https://substrait.io">Substrait</a>) and builds software components that embrace these standards for maximum interoperability and performance. This includes free and open source software like Ibis.</p>

</div>
<p>This also includes a commercially licensed product: <a href="https://voltrondata.com/theseus">Theseus</a>, Voltron Data’s accelerator-native data processing engine. Theseus is a separate project built by a different team at Voltron Data. Most Ibis contributors do not need to know about Theseus. Most Ibis users will probably never use Theseus. But the two projects are related parts of Voltron Data’s strategy.</p>
<p>The strategy goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Big changes are afoot in the world of computing hardware. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s Law</a> is coming to an end. Accelerated hardware such as NVIDIA GPUs are becoming more important for performance and efficiency—not just for AI and ML, but data analytics too.</li>
<li>Big changes in hardware require big changes in software. But software has lagged behind in some areas. Distributed big data analytics is one area where the performance of existing software has lagged way behind hardware.</li>
<li>Organizations choose data platforms based on many factors. No one chooses a data platform <em>only</em> because it can run very fast on accelerated hardware.</li>
<li>Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a composable data processing engine that could be embedded into <em>any</em> data platform to enable that platform to run jobs on accelerated hardware? Then the platform builders wouldn’t need to duplicate efforts. And organizations wouldn’t need to migrate to different platforms to accelerate their workloads.</li>
<li>Voltron Data built Theseus to be that composable engine.</li>
<li>Voltron Data is <em>not</em> building a platform (PaaS or SaaS) around Theseus. Instead, it is partnering with other companies and organizations to embed Theseus in their platforms.</li>
<li>Theseus is great for very large-scale ETL workloads with very high throughput needs. For other types of workloads, other engines are better. Voltron Data wants to make it easy to choose the best engine for your workload. Your choice of engine or platform should not limit your choice of other tools.</li>
<li>For example (this is where Ibis comes in!), your choice of engine or platform should not limit your choice of Python dataframe API. So Ibis works with 20+ engines, including Theseus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, Voltron Data will be more successful if Ibis is successful. And the same is true of any other company with an engine or platform that is the best choice for some type of workload. Ibis makes it easy to switch which engine you’re using. So the only reason to fear Ibis is if you have an uncompetitive engine and your strategy for retaining customers is to lock them into using a proprietary API that prevents them from switching.</p>

<p>This is a great, and natural, question – if Voltron Data wants a standard Python dataframe API, why not just use pandas? The reason is relatively simple: the pandas API inherently does not scale. This is largely due to the expectation of ordered results and the index. pandas is implemented for single-threaded execution and has a lot of baggage when it comes to distributed execution. While projects like Modin and pandas on Spark (formerly Koalas) attempt to scale the pandas API, any project that attempts the feat is doomed to a dubious support matrix of operations.</p>
<p>Instead, Wes McKinney envisioned Ibis as a portable Python dataframe where the API is decoupled from the execution engine. Ibis code scales to the backend it is connected to. Any other Python dataframe library locks you into its execution engine. While they may claim to be easy to migrate to, this is rarely the case. The founders of Voltron Data experienced these pains with the pandas API themselves in previous efforts, including cuDF. For Theseus and as an open source standard, we believe Ibis is the right approach.</p>
<p>Instead of using Snowpark Python for Snowflake, you can use Ibis on Snowflake. Instead of using PySpark or pandas on Spark, you can use Ibis on Spark. Instead of using the pandas API on BigQuery (built on top of Ibis), you can use Ibis on BigQuery. Instead of using PyStarburst on Starburst Galaxy, you can use Ibis on Starburst Galaxy. Instead of using the Polars Python on the Polars execution engine, you can use Ibis on Polars. Instead of using DataFusion Python on DataFusion execution engine, you can use Ibis on DataFusion. Instead of executing SQL strings on DuckDB through the Python client, you can use Ibis on DuckDB. And so on…</p>
<p>Ibis brings a Python dataframe interface to data platforms that only have SQL, and brings a standard Python dataframe interface to data platforms that have their own Python dataframe interface. It is the only portable Python dataframe that can serve as a standard across the data ecosystem.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Voltron Data supports Ibis because it can serve as a universal Python dataframe API for <strong>any</strong> backend engine. Ibis works great whether you need to query a CSV file on your laptop with DuckDB, run a big ETL job in the cloud with Snowflake or Starburst Galaxy, or process hundreds of terabytes in minutes on a platform running Theseus on NVIDIA GPUs. With Ibis, you have the choice of 20+ backends, and the code you write is the same regardless of which backend you choose to use.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ibis-project/governance">Ibis is independently governed</a> and not owned by Voltron Data. Currently, four out of five members of the steering committee are employed by Voltron Data (the fifth being at Alphabet working on Google BigQuery). We are working toward a more diverse representation of companies and organizations as the project continues to grow.</p>
<p>Voltron Data also welcomes this dilution of power and influence! A healthy open source project is one that is not controlled by a single entity. This is true of <a href="https://arrow.apache.org">Apache Arrow</a> and other open source projects that Voltron Data employees have been instrumental in building.</p>
