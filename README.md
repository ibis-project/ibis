Hive, Spark) and SQL databases (Postgres, etc.). Its goal is to simplify
analytical workflows and make you more productive.

- [Apache Kudu](http://getkudu.io)
- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
- PostgreSQL (Experimental)
- SQLite
- Direct execution of ibis expressions against pandas object (Experimental)
- [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.yandex)
