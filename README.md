Ibis
===

Ibis is a Python data analysis library enabling a 100% Python user workflow on
top of big data systems for maximum performance and scalability. It was
co-created by the creator of pandas (github.com/pydata/pandas) and designed to
have a familiar user interface for folks used to small data on single machines
in Python.

Ibis targets Impala (github.com/cloudera/impala) as a first class execution
engine, but may grow to encompass other backend systems in the future.
