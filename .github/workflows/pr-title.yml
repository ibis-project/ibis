            Ibis follows the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for release automation.

            The PR title and description are used as the merge commit message.

            Please update your PR title and description to match the specification.

            See https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/blob/main/.releaserc.js
            for the list of acceptable prefixes, eg "feat:", "fix:", "chore:", etc.

            The commitlint output is:

            ```
            ${{ needs.verify-commitlint.outputs.lint_output }}
            ```

      - name: fail the check because commitlint failed
        run: exit 1
