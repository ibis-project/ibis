Example('1', '2', '3', '4', '5', []) has failed due to the following errors:
  `a`: '1' is not an int
  `b`: '2' is not an int
  `d`: '4' is not either None or a float
  `e`: '5' is not a tuple of ints
  `f`: [] is not coercible to an int

Expected signature: Example(a: int, b: int = 0, c: str = 'foo', d: Optional[float] = None, e: tuple = (1, 2, 3), f: CoercedTo[int] = 1)
