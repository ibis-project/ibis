## Reporting and Enforcement Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
(privately) reported by contacting the [Ibis Code of Conduct
committee](mailto:ibis-conduct.5e76f3596b52d3bb7ca89a83e6cdbb54.show-sender@streams.zulipchat.com).

The committee currently consists of [the Ibis Project Steering Council
members](https://github.com/ibis-project/governance/blob/main/governance.md#steering-committee-members)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The committee is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. In addition, the online form allows you to submit a report
anonymously. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by members of
the project's steering council.
