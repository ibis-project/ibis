## Reporting and Enforcement Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the Ibis Code of Conduct committee at
ibis-conduct@googlegroups.com. You can also report

The committee currently consists of:

- Phillip Cloud
- Wes McKinney
- Krisztián Szűcs

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The committee is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. In addition, the online form allows you to submit a report
anonymously. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
