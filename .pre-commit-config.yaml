    # we need to use this commit or later, to pickup the fix that splits
    # trailing comma syntax into call vs def, both of which weren't implemented
    # until python 3.6 (3.5 has just the call syntax) and we need to support
    # 3.5 for a few months.

        # a side effect of black running exclude filters and then include
        # filters (the built-in black behavior) is that a command line such as
        # black --exclude foo.py foo.py will still format foo.py. We avoid this
        # in pre-commit by not passing staged files.
